"A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law."
"In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court."
"Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court."
The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary.
The place where a court sits is known as a venue.
"The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities."
"The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin iūrisdictiō, from iūris, ""of the law,"" + dīcō, ""to declare,"" + -tiō, noun-forming suffix), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it."
"According to William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the āctor or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the reus or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the jūdex or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy."
"It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury."
"The term ""the court"" is also used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges."
"The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as ""the bench"" (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as ""the bar"").In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted."
"In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc."
"The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed."
"The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and the date of repayment."
"A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower."
The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan.
"In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants."
"Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent."
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies.
"For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding."
"Polka dot is a pattern consisting of an array of large filled circles of the same size.Polka dots are commonly seen on children's clothing, toys, furniture, ceramics, and Central European folk art but they appear in a wide array of contexts."
"The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as bathing suits and lingerie."
"Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal clothing."
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.
Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.
"Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks."
"Most countries have institutionalised a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities."
"In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords."
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world.
"In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties –  notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds –  have played a central role over many centuries."
"The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590)."
"Tunisia, officially the Republic of Tunisia, is the northernmost country in Africa."
"It is a part of the Maghreb region of North Africa, and is bordered by Algeria to the west and southwest, Libya to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east; covering 163,610 km2 (63,170 sq mi), with a population of 11 million."
"It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert, with much of its remaining territory arable land."
"Its 1,300 km (810 mi) of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin."
"Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is Tunis, located on its northeastern coast, which lends the country its name."
"From early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers."
"Phoenicians began to arrive in the 12th century BC, establishing several settlements, of which Carthage emerged as the most powerful by the 7th century BC."
"A major mercantile empire and a military rival of the Roman Republic, Carthage was defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introducing Christianity and leaving architectural legacies like the amphitheatre of El Jem."
"After several attempts starting in 647, Muslims conquered all of Tunisia by 697, bringing Islam and Arab culture to the local inhabitants."
"The Ottoman Empire established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years, until the French conquered Tunisia in 1881."
"Tunisia gained independence under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba, who declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957."
"Today, Tunisia is the smallest nation in North Africa, and its culture and identity are rooted in this centuries-long intersection of different cultures and ethnicities."
"In 2011, the Tunisian Revolution, triggered by the lack of freedom and democracy under the 24-year rule of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, overthrew his regime and catalyzed the broader Arab Spring across the region."
"Free multiparty parliamentary elections were held shortly after; the country again voted for parliament on 26 October 2014, and for president on 23 November 2014."
"Tunisia remains a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic; and is the only North African country classified as ""Free"" by Freedom House, and considered the only fully democratic state in the Arab World in the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index."
"It is one of the few countries in Africa ranking high in the  Human Development Index, with one of the highest per capita incomes in the continent."
Tunisia is well integrated into the international community.
"It is a member of the United Nations, La Francophonie, the Arab League, the OIC, the African Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the International Criminal Court, and the Group of 77, among others."
"It maintains close economic and political relations with some European countries, particularly with France, and Italy, which geographically lie very close to it."
"Tunisia also has an association agreement with the European Union, and has also attained the status of a major non-NATO ally of the United States."
The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes.
"It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish."
"Goldfish released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp)."
"It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000 years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed."
"Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known)."
The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated one-toed hoofed mammal.
It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
"The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today."
"Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC."
"Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses."
"These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated."
"There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior."
"Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response."
"Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults."
"Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth."
Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.
"They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years."
"Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited ""hot bloods"" with speed and endurance; ""cold bloods"", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and ""warmbloods"", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe."
"There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses."
"Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy."
"Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control."
"Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares."
"Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers."
The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
"Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel."
A male that has been castrated is a capon.
An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
"Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)."
Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
"Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011."
There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
"There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature."
"Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent."
"From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC."
"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."
"A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes."
It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis.
"A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
"A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases."
"A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual."
"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources."
"Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet."
"The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example."
"Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning."
"Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet."
Hence managing information in an information world has become very easy simply because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.
"The services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination ""library and information services"", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently."
"A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant."
The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius.
"Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number (Circle with 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=0}
   is a degenerate case)."
"This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted."
"Specifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior."
"In everyday use, the term ""circle"" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc."
"A circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations."
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings.
"It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand."
A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings.
"The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier."
The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points.
"Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut."
Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s.
"The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument."
There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played  across the player's lap).
"Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar""."
"The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber."
"The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed."
"The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States."
"Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing no resonant chamber."
"A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or ""overdrive"")."
Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback.
"As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music."
"The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock."
The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture.
The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide.
"It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and pop."
A kitten is a juvenile cat.
"After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally dependent on their mothers for survival."
They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days.
"After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest."
"After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow baby teeth."
Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.
"In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line."
"Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as ""y = mx + b"" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as ""y = mx + c"".Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the ""vertical change"" to the ""horizontal change"" between (any) two distinct points on a line."
"Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (""rise over run""), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line."
"A line that is decreasing has a negative ""rise""."
"The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan."
"The steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope."
A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.
"The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical."
A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right.
"The slope is positive, i.e."
"m
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m>0}
  ."
A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right.
"The slope is negative, i.e."
"m
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m<0}
  ."
If a line is horizontal the slope is zero.
This is a constant function.
"If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below).The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 − y1) = Δy."
"For relatively short distances, where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 − x1) = Δx."
Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line.
"In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is

  
    
      
        m
        =
        
          
            
              
                y

                  1
                
              
            
          
        
        ."
{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}
The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering.
"Through trigonometry, the slope m of a line is related to its angle of incline θ by the tangent function

  
    
      
        m
        =
        tan
        ⁡
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle m=\tan(\theta )}
  Thus, a 45° rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45° falling line has a slope of −1."
"As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point."
"When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points."
"When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve."
"This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors."
"Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment."
"Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)."
"It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients."
"Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure."
A number of natural states of water exist.
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog.
"Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state."
"When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow."
The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
"Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans."
"Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)."
"Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea."
Water plays an important role in the world economy.
Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.
Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.
"Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals."
"Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes."
"Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing."
"Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing."
A skull and crossbones is a symbol consisting of a human skull and two long bones crossed together under or behind the skull.
The design originated in the Late Middle Ages as a symbol of death and especially as a memento mori on tombstones.
"In modern contexts, it is generally used as a hazard symbol that warns of danger, usually in regard to poisonous substances,  such as deadly chemicals.It is also associated with piracy and software piracy, due to its historical use in some Jolly Roger flags."
"A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, and usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant."
"Gunpowder (""black powder"") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century."
"Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield."
A cannon is a type of heavy artillery weapon.
"The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed."
"In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen into decline, replaced by guns or artillery, if not a more specific term such as howitzer or mortar, except for high-caliber automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called autocannons."
"The earliest known depiction of cannons appeared in Song dynasty China as early as the 12th century; however, solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannons do not appear until the 13th century."
"In 1288 Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannon in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period."
"By the early 14th century, depictions of cannon had appeared in the Middle East and Europe, and recorded usage of cannon began appearing almost immediately after."
"By the end of the 14th century, cannons were widespread throughout Eurasia."
"Cannons were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374, when large cannons were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe."
"Cannons featured prominently as siege weapons, and ever larger pieces appeared."
"In 1464 a 16,000 kg (35,000 lbs) cannon known as the Great Turkish Bombard was created in the Ottoman Empire."
"Cannons as field artillery became more important after 1453, with the introduction of limber, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility."
"European cannons reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient ""classic form"" around 1480."
This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.
The Three Stooges (promoted as The Three Stooges: The Movie) is a 2012 American slapstick comedy film based on the film shorts from 1934 to 1959 starring the comedy trio of the same name.
"The film was produced, written and directed by the Farrelly brothers and co-written by Mike Cerrone."
"It stars Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso, re-creating the eponymous characters played by Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard."
The film's story places the Stooges in a then-modern setting.
"After over a decade of casting problems, principal photography took place from May to July 2011."
"The film was released on April 13, 2012, by 20th Century Fox."
"A shape or figure is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material type."
"A plane shape, two-dimensional shape, or 2D shape (plane figure, two-dimensional figure, or 2D figure) is constrained to lie on a plane, in contrast to solid figures."
"Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., Stools, Chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds, and hammocks)."
"Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers)."
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.
"In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose."
"It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood."
Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.
"People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites."
"Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones."
"Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne."
"The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone."
Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt.
"This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory."
"The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping."
"The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented."
Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century.
"The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs."
The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles.
The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism.
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.
"France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française), is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans."
"Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and several islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean."
"Due to its several coastal territories, France has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world."
"France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Andorra and Spain in Europe, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname and Brazil in the Americas."
"Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021)."
"France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice."
"Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age."
"Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language."
"The Germanic Franks  formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire."
"The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987."
"In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralised feudal kingdom."
"Philip II successfully strengthened royal power and defeated his rivals to double the size of the crown lands; by the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe."
"From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result."
"The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second-largest in the world."
The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country.
France again emerged as Europe's dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War.
"Inadequate economic policies, inequitable taxes and frequent wars (notably a defeat in the Seven Years' War and costly involvement in the American War of Independence), left the kingdom in a precarious economic situation by the end of the 18th century."
"This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day."
"France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire."
The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history.
"The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870."
"Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, as well as economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque."
"France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost."
"It was among the Allied powers of World War II, but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940."
"Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War."
The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle.
"Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France."
"France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy."
"It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018."
"France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world."
"France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy and human development."
"It remains a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state."
"France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and La Francophonie."

"A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed, and is called a normal deviate."
Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.
Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem.
"It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases."
"Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies."
"For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of normal deviates is a normal deviate."
"Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed."
A normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve.
"However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions)."
"A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the passage of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air."
"Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window."
"Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather."
Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.
"In addition to this, many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh  (often made of aluminum or fibreglass) to keep bugs or insects out when the window is opened."
"Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, Rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows."
"The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria c. 100 AD."
"Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan."
"In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century."
"In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups."
Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.
"In the field of international relations, a sphere of influence (SOI) is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity.While there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of soft power."
"Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence."
High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.
"In more extreme cases, a country within the ""sphere of influence"" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony."
This was the case with the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc after World War II.
The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present.
"It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers."
Sometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence.
"In the colonial era the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying between the empires of Britain/Russia and Britain/France respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial powers."
"Likewise, after World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, three of which later consolidated into West Germany and the remaining one became East Germany, the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the Warsaw Pact."
"The term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a shopping mall is said to have a 'sphere of influence' that designates the geographical area where it dominates the retail trade."
A tire iron (also tire lever or tire spoon) is a specialized metal tool used in working with tires.
Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift to the use of tubeless tires in the late 1950s.
"Bicycle tire irons are still in use for those tires which have a separate inner tube, and can have a hooked C-shape cut into one end of the iron so that it may be hooked on a bicycle spoke to hold it in place."
"On the x86 architecture, a double fault exception occurs if the processor encounters a problem while trying to service a pending interrupt or exception."
An example situation when a double fault would occur is when an interrupt is triggered but the segment in which the interrupt handler resides is invalid.
"If the processor encounters a problem when calling the double fault handler, a triple fault is generated and the processor shuts down."
"As double faults can only happen due to kernel bugs, they are rarely caused by user space programs in a modern protected mode operating system, unless the program somehow gains kernel access (some viruses and also some low-level DOS programs)."
Other processors like PowerPC or SPARC generally save state to predefined and reserved machine registers.
A double fault will then be a situation where another exception happens while the processor is still using the contents of these registers to process the exception.
"SPARC processors have four levels of such registers, i.e."
they have a 4-window register system.
"Home of the Gentry (Russian: Дворянское гнездо Dvoryánskoye gnezdó pronounced [dvɐˈrʲanskʲɪɪ ɡnʲɪˈzdo]), also translated as A Nest of the Gentlefolk, A Nest of the Gentry and Liza , is a novel by Ivan Turgenev published in the January 1859 issue of Sovremennik."
It was enthusiastically received by the Russian society and remained his least controversial and most widely read novel until the end of the 19th century.
"Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads."
It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var.
"oleracea), and belongs to the ""cole crops"" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var."
botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var.
gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var.
sabauda).
"A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb)."
"Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer."
"Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large."
"As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4 oz)."
"Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination."
"Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases."
"Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD."
"By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine."
"They can be prepared many different ways for eating; they can be pickled, fermented (for dishes such as sauerkraut), steamed, stewed, roasted, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw."
"Raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin K, vitamin C, and dietary fiber."
"World production of cabbage and other brassicas in 2020 was 71 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the total."
"In arithmetic and algebra, the fourth power of a number n is the result of multiplying four instances of n together."
"So:

n4 = n × n × n × nFourth powers are also formed by multiplying a number by its cube."
"Furthermore, they are squares of squares."
"The sequence of fourth powers of integers (also known as biquadrates or tesseractic numbers) is:

0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000, 14641, 20736, 28561, 38416, 50625, 65536, 83521, 104976, 130321, 160000, 194481, 234256, 279841, 331776, 390625, 456976, 531441, 614656, 707281, 810000, ... (sequence A000583 in the OEIS)."
"A ship's company comprises all officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel aboard a naval vessel."
"The size of the ship's company (the complement) is the number of people on board, excluding civilians and guests."
"D-Link Corporation is a Taiwanese multinational networking equipment manufacturing corporation headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan."
It was founded in March 1986 in Taipei as Datex Systems Inc.
Self-denial (related but different from self-abnegation or self-sacrifice) is an act of letting go of the self as with altruistic abstinence – the willingness to forgo personal pleasures or undergo personal trials in the pursuit of the increased good of another.
"Various religions and cultures take differing views of self-denial, some considering it a positive trait and others considering it a negative one."
"According to some Protestants, self-denial is considered a superhuman virtue only obtainable through Jesus."
Some critics of self-denial suggest that self-denial can lead to self-hatred.
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"A coffee table is a low table designed to be placed in a sitting area for convenient support of beverages, remote controls, magazines, books (especially large, illustrated coffee table books), decorative objects, and other small items.Most coffee tables are made of wood (though faux wood tables are increasingly common) or glass and metal, typically, stainless steel or aluminum and may incorporate cabinets or drawers."
Coffee tables were thought to initially be constructed in Renaissance England.
"A cushion is a soft bag of some ornamental material, usually stuffed with wool, hair, feathers, polyester staple fiber, non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments."
"It may be used for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch."
"Decorative cushions often have a patterned cover material, and are used as decoration for furniture."
"A cushion is also referred to as a bolster, hassock, headrest, a tush, and a sham.Cushions and rugs can be used temporarily outside to soften a hard ground."
They can be placed on sunloungers and used to prevent annoyances from moist grass and biting insects.
Some dialects of English use this word to refer to throw pillows as well.
The cushion is a very ancient article of furniture; the inventories of the contents of palaces and great houses in the early Middle Ages constantly made mention of them.
"Cushions were then often of great size, covered with leather, and firm enough to serve as a seat, but the steady tendency of all furniture has been to grow smaller with time."
"Today, the cushion is considered an upholstery item."
"In computing, file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved."
"Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stopped and the next began, or where any piece of data was located when it was time to retrieve it."
"By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified."
"Taking its name from the way a paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a ""file."""
"The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a ""file system."""
There are many different kinds of file systems.
"Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, size and more."
Some file systems have been designed to be used for specific applications.
"For example, the ISO 9660 file system is designed specifically for optical discs."
File systems can be used on numerous different types of storage devices that use different kinds of media.
"As of 2019, hard disk drives have been key storage devices and are projected to remain so for the foreseeable future."
"Other kinds of media that are used include SSDs, magnetic tapes, and optical discs."
"In some cases, such as with tmpfs, the computer's main memory (random-access memory, RAM) is used to create a temporary file system for short-term use."
"Some file systems are used on local data storage devices; others provide file access via a network protocol (for example, NFS, SMB, or 9P clients)."
"Some file systems are ""virtual"", meaning that the supplied ""files"" (called virtual files) are computed on request (such as procfs and sysfs) or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store."
The file system manages access to both the content of files and the metadata about those files.
"It is responsible for arranging storage space; reliability, efficiency, and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations."
Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface.
"Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint)."
Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer.
"Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse."
There are many digital art programs and devices.
"A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark."
"The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used."
Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard.
Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history.
It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas.
The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.
"In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing."
"A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch."
"An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman."
"In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography)."
"Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law."
"Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet."
"The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features."
"As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms."
"For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on."
The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography.
"In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types."
"Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography."
A region has its own nature that could not be moved.
"The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.)."
The second nature is its physical elements complex that was built by people in the past.
The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.
A utility knife is any type of knife used for general manual work purposes.
"Such knives were originally fixed-blade knives with durable cutting edges suitable for rough work such as cutting cordage, cutting/scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish scales, reshaping timber, and other tasks."
"Craft knives are small utility knives used as precision-oriented tools for finer, more delicate tasks such as carving and papercutting."
"Today, the term ""utility knife"" also includes small folding-, retractable- and/or replaceable-razor blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry."
"The latter type is sometimes generically called a Stanley knife, after a prominent brand."
"There is also a utility knife for kitchen use, which is sized between a chef's knife and paring knife."
"In vertebrate anatomy, hip (or ""coxa"" in medical terminology) refers to either an anatomical region or a joint."
"The hip region is located lateral and anterior to the gluteal region, inferior to the iliac crest, and overlying the greater trochanter of the femur, or ""thigh bone""."
"In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the hip bone or acetabulum which forms part of the hip region."
"The hip joint, scientifically referred to as the acetabulofemoral joint (art."
"coxae), is the joint between the head of the femur and acetabulum of the pelvis and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g., standing) and dynamic (e.g., walking or running) postures."
"The hip joints have very important roles in retaining balance, and for maintaining the pelvic inclination angle."
"Pain of the hip may be the result of numerous causes, including nervous, osteoarthritic, infectious, traumatic, and genetic."
An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes.
"A coffeemaker, coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee."
"While there are many different types of coffeemakers using several different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family."
"Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel."
This is also called automatic drip-brew.
"Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves."
"Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it."
"In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property)."
"Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally."
"However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent."
"The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute."
"The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing."
"This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object."
"The distinction between ""collective property"" and ""private property"" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc."
"), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced."
An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts.
"A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit."
"The unqualified term ""property"" is often used to refer specifically to real property."
"A role (also rôle or social role) is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation."
It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position.
It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society.
"Social role theory posits the following about social behavior:

The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles."
"Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society."
"Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors."
"When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms."
"Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change."
"The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.The notion of the role can be and is examined in the social sciences, specifically economics, sociology and organizational theory."
Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
"It typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing, ""non-linear"" manner, such that many ideas are generated in an emergent cognitive fashion."
"Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn."
"Following divergent thinking, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ""correct"" solution."
The psychologist J.P. Guilford first coined the terms convergent thinking and divergent thinking in 1956.
West or Occident is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass.
It is the opposite direction from East and is the direction in which the sun sets.
An alligator is a crocodilian in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae.
The two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis).
"Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains."
"Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago.The name ""alligator"" is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto, the Spanish term for ""the lizard"", which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator."
Later English spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto.
"A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process."
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
"In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity."
"The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment."
"Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, product designer, web designer or interior designer), but also others such as architects and engineers."
"A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods."
"The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design."
"A branch, sometimes called a ramus in botany, is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub)."
Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs.
"The term twig often refers to a terminus, while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk."
"Due to a broad range of species of trees, branches and twigs can be found in many different shapes and sizes."
"While branches can be nearly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches."
"A number of mathematical properties are associated with tree branchings; they are natural examples of fractal patterns in nature, and, as observed by Leonardo da Vinci, their cross-sectional areas closely follow the da Vinci branching rule."
"China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia."
"It is the world's most populous country, with a population of more than 1.4 billion."
"China spans five geographical time zones and borders 14 different countries, the second most of any country in the world after Russia."
"Covering an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third or fourth largest country."
"The country consists of 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau)."
The national capital is Beijing.
China emerged as one of the world's first civilizations in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain.
China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.
"For millennia, China's political system was based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE."
"Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times."
"In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire."
"The succeeding Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements."
The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions.
"Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Road brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa."
"The Qing dynasty, China's last dynasty, which formed the territorial basis for modern China, suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century."
"The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty."
China was invaded by the Empire of Japan during World War II.
The Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan.
"Both claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, although the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971."
"China conducted a series of economic reforms since 1978, and entered into the World Trade Organization in 2001."
China is currently governed as a unitary one-party socialist republic by the CCP.
"China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the RCEP, and is a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit."
"It ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and ethnic minorities."
"Chinese authorities have been criticized by political dissidents and human rights activists for widespread human rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass surveillance of their citizens and violent suppression of protests."
"China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the world's second wealthiest country by total wealth."
The country has a fast growing major economy and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter.
China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and second-largest defense budget.
A roadblock is a temporary installation set up to control or block traffic along a road.
"The reasons for one could be:

Roadworks
Temporary road closure during special events
Police chase
Robbery
Sobriety checkpointIn peaceful circumstances, they are usually installed by the police or road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during wars and are usually staffed by heavily armed soldiers in that case."
"During protests and riots, both police and demonstrators sometimes use roadblocks."
"A suckling pig is a piglet fed on its mother's milk (i.e., a piglet which is still a ""suckling"")."
"In culinary contexts, a suckling pig is slaughtered between the ages of two and six weeks."
"It is traditionally cooked whole, often roasted, in various cuisines."
It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.
The meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for pork rinds.
The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of collagen in a young pig.
"Cornish game hen (also Rock Cornish game hen) is the USDA-approved name for a particular variety of broiler chicken, produced from a cross between the Cornish and White Plymouth Rock chicken breeds, that is served young and immature, weighing no more than two pounds (900 g) ready to cook.Despite the name, the Cornish game hen is not a game bird."
"The name is also a misnomer because both males and females are served as Cornish game hens, meaning that many are not actually hens."
"Bred to develop a large breast over a short period of time, the fowl weighs roughly 2.5 pounds (1.1 kilograms) when slaughtered at four to six weeks of age and typically commands a higher price per pound than mature chicken."
Adult Cornish game hens are not smaller than standard broiler chickens; the size of cooked Cornish game hens is due solely to the very young age at which they are slaughtered.
A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor.
"A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale."
"Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol."
The vestibulospinal tract is a neural tract in the central nervous system.
"Specifically, it is a component of the extrapyramidal system and is classified as a component of the medial pathway."
"Like other descending motor pathways, the vestibulospinal fibers of the tract relay information from nuclei to motor neurons."
The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head.
The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract.
"The function of these motor commands is to alter muscle tone, extend, and change the position of the limbs and head with the goal of supporting posture and maintaining balance of the body and head."
"A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound)."
"In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the epidermis of the skin."
The Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans) is a species of marine fish in the family Istiophoridae of the order Perciformes.
"It is found in the Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, except for large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic, from the surface to depths of 200 m (656 ft)."
The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.
"Tests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to 111 kilometres per hour; however, more conservative estimates of 37 to 55 kilometres per hour are more widely accepted."
"More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of 36 km/h (22 mph).Atlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods."
"A space suit or spacesuit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, vacuum and temperature extremes."
"Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are necessary for extravehicular activity (EVA), work done outside spacecraft."
"Space suits have been worn for such work in Earth orbit, on the surface of the Moon, and en route back to Earth from the Moon."
"Modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum."
"A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft."
"Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity)."
"IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable."
"IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini G4C suit."
"They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change."
"EVA suits, such as the EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks."
"They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.Some of these requirements also apply to pressure suits worn for other specialized tasks, such as high-altitude reconnaissance flight."
"At altitudes above the Armstrong limit, around 19,000 m (62,000 ft), water boils at body temperature and pressurized suits are needed."
The first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s.
The first space suit worn by a human in space was the Soviet SK-1 suit worn by Yuri Gagarin in 1961.
"A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature."
The refrigerator should be kept at or below 4 °C (40 °F) and the freezer should be regulated at −18 °C (0 °F).
Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world.
"The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage."
A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water.
The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).
A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer.
"The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half."
The first cooling systems for food involved ice.
"Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s."
"In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built."
The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854.
"In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented."
In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit.
The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s.
Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940.
"Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace."
Freezer units are used in households as well as in industry and commerce.
Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models.
"The freezer-over-refrigerator style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend."
"A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers."
"Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door."
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes.
Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages.
A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about one metre (3 ft 3 in) wide with a capacity of 0.6 m3 (21 cu ft).
"Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen."
The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before.
"Freezers allow people to buy perishable food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and have bulk purchases."
"Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, or ropemaking."
Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine.
Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.
Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework.
"A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process."
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
"In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity."

"A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods."
"The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design."
American Idiot is a sung-through rock musical based on the concept album of the same name by punk rock band Green Day.
"After a run at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009, the show moved to the St. James Theatre on Broadway."
"Previews began on March 24, 2010, and the musical officially opened on April 20, 2010."
"The show closed on April 24, 2011, after 422 performances."
"While Green Day did not appear in the production, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong performed the role of ""St. Jimmy"" occasionally throughout the run."
"The story, expanded from that of the album, centres on three disaffected young men, Johnny, Will and Tunny."
"Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban lifestyle and parental restrictions, while Will stays at home to work out his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, Heather."
The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and excitement of the city.
"Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city, joins the military and is shipped off to war."
"Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows to dislike, has a relationship and experiences lost love."
The book was written by Armstrong and director Michael Mayer.
The music was composed by Green Day and the lyrics were by Armstrong.
"The score included all the songs from the band's original American Idiot album, as well as additional Green Day songs from the 2009 concept album 21st Century Breakdown, and ""When It's Time"", a song originally only released as a single in Britain."
The musical won two Tony Awards: Best Scenic Design of a Musical for Christine Jones and Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Kevin Adams.
It also received a nomination for Best Musical.
"In 2011, its Broadway cast recording won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album."
"A doll is a model typically of a human or humanoid character, often used as a toy for children, especially little girls."
Dolls have also been used in traditional religious rituals throughout the world.
"Traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe."
"The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome."
"They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art."
"Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, from the 15th century."
"With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced."
"During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles."
"In its most general sense, the term ""world"" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is."
The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
"Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a ""plurality of worlds""."
Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts.
"In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as ""[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be""."
"Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been."
"Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the ""horizon of all horizons""."
"In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind."
"Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent."
"In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice."
"A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview."
Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.
"In various contexts, the term ""world"" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope."
"In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents."
"Other examples include terms such as ""world religion"", ""world language"", ""world government"", ""world war"", ""world population"", ""world economy"" or ""world championship""."
"In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space."
Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals.
"On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature."
"They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere."
"Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology."
"There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common."
"Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802."
It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera.
"The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratus, cirrus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus."
Low-level  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.
However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-.
"In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing."
Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes.
"They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical."
Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties.
"Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names."
"In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types."
"They may have the appearance of  stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples."
"They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth."
Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond.
"However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water."
Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth.
"They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect."
"The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere."
Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change.
Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.
"A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter."
It is a type of batter bread.
Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide.
"In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe."
"In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake."
A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles.
"A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a palačinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used."
"When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake."
Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries.
"Like waffles, commercially prepared frozen pancakes are available from companies like Eggo."
"When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland and the US."
"Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes Blini, Kaletez, Ploye, and Memil-buchimgae."
"Pancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions."
"In North America, they are typically considered a breakfast food and serve a similar function to waffles."
"In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as ""Pancake Day"", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent."
Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
"It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches."
It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
"Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers."
The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
"The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F)."
It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
"The meaning of the name ""ice cream"" varies from one country to another."
"Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk."
"Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir."
"Frozen custard, with eggs added to cream and sugar."
Ice milk.
"Sorbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base."
"Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea."
"Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.In some countries, such as the United States, ""ice cream"" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream."
"Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled ""frozen dairy dessert"" instead."
"In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants."
"Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,  almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan."
"Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones."
"Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska."
"A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky."
It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc.
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.
Rainbows can be full circles.
"However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye."
"In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side."
"This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it."
"In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc."
This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.
"An infidel (literally ""unfaithful"") is a person accused of disbelief in the central tenets of one's own religion, such as members of another religion, or the irreligious.Infidel is an ecclesiastical term in Christianity around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were baptized and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the faith."
The term infidel was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity.
"After the ancient world, the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (cf."
"pagan).In modern literature, the term infidel includes in its scope atheists, polytheists, animists, heathens and pagans.A willingness to identify other religious people as infidels corresponds to preference for orthodoxy over pluralism."
"Dexter: New Blood is an American crime drama mystery miniseries developed for Showtime as a continuation of the series Dexter, developed by original series showrunner Clyde Phillips and directed by Marcos Siega."
"The show features Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter reprising their roles as Dexter and Debra Morgan, respectively, alongside new cast members Jack Alcott, Julia Jones, Johnny Sequoyah, Alano Miller and Clancy Brown."
"The story is set 10 years after the events of the original series finale ""Remember the Monsters?"
""", which was broadcast in 2013."
"It premiered on Showtime on November 7, 2021."
Character evidence is a term used in the law of evidence to describe any testimony or document submitted for the purpose of proving that a person acted in a particular way on a particular occasion based on the character or disposition of that person.
"In the United States, Federal Rule of Evidence 404 maps out its permissible and prohibited uses in trials."
"Three factors typically determine the admissibility of character evidence: 

the purpose the character evidence is being used for
the form in which the character evidence is offered
the type of proceeding (civil or criminal) in which the character evidence is offered"
"Calochortus elegans is a species of flowering plant in the lily family known by the common name elegant Mariposa lily, cat's ear, elegant cat's ears or star tulip."
"It is native to the western United States from northern California to Montana.It is a perennial herb producing a slender, generally unbranched stem up to 15 centimeters in height."
The basal leaf is 10 to 20 centimeters long and does not wither at flowering.
The inflorescence bears 1 to 7 erect bell-shaped flowers.
Each flower has three sepals and three petals with very hairy inner surfaces and edges.
Each petal is greenish white in color with a purple crescent above a hairless patch at the base.
"The fruit is a winged capsule about 2 centimeters long.The bulb is a choice wild root vegetable when eaten cooked, and can be eaten raw to avoid starvation."

"In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles)."
It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length.
"A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted 
  
    
      
        ◻
      
    
    {\displaystyle \square }
   ABCD."
"Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future."
"It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience."
"Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars."
"Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as ""what a clock reads"".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime."
"Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship."
Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates).
"However, the numerical values are different for different observers."
"In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer."
"Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley."
General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds.
"At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities."
The SI base unit of time is the second.
Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.
"An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life."
"To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted."
The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is.
"It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time."
Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum.
General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works.
"Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes."
"Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy."
Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time.
"Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart."
"Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below)."
"Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (""time is money"") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans."
"There are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time."
"In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another."
"A private protected area, also known as a private reserve, is not an official category within IUCN's Protected Area guidelines, but includes those protected areas that fall under geographical space that is privately owned, 'kept aside' for public benefit, and will be likely to fall into any one of the IUCN Protected Area Management Categories.The IUCN defines a private protected area as “a land parcel of any size that is..."": 

""Predominantly managed for biodiversity conservation;
""Protected with or without formal government recognition; and
""Is owned or otherwise secured by individuals, communities, corporations, or non-governmental organisations.”A Private Protected Area represents a private initiative towards preserving biodiversity, which indicates the importance of the involvement of individuals, corporations, and other private bodies in the understanding and maintenance of protected areas."
"In Eastern and Southern Africa, privately owned lands play an important role in conserving critical biodiversity."
"Private protected areas in Southern Africa alone protect millions of ecologically important areas, especially in critical buffer zones and corridor areas."
"""The Brown Paper Bag Test"" is a term in African-American oral history to describe a colorist discriminatory practice within the African-American community in the 20th century, in which an individual's skin tone is compared to the color of a brown paper bag."
This test can be traced back to the time of slavery where slave masters kept the lighter-skinned slaves inside.
The test was allegedly used to determine what privileges an individual could have; only those with a skin color that matched or was lighter than a brown paper bag were allowed admission or membership privileges.
"The test was believed by many to be used in the 20th century by many African-American social institutions such as sororities, fraternities, and churches."
The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification and colorism within the African-American population.
People were barred from having access to several public spaces and resources because of their darker complexion.
The test was used at the entrance to social functions wherein a brown paper bag was stuck at the door and anyone who was darker than the bag was denied entry.
Volume is a scalar quantity expressing the amount of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface.
"For example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or 3D shape occupies or contains."
"Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre."
"The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces."
Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes.
"Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas."
Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary.
One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.
The volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by fluid displacement.
Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas.
The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances.
"However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not additive.In differential geometry, volume is expressed by means of the volume form, and is an important global Riemannian invariant."
"In thermodynamics, volume is a fundamental parameter, and is a conjugate variable to pressure."
"A solar furnace is a structure that uses concentrated solar power to produce high temperatures, usually for industry."
Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point.
"The temperature at the focal point may reach 3,500 °C (6,330 °F), and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials."
"The largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France, opened in 1970."
"It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror."
A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.
"Used in politics and law it is a term to refer to the collective or community of an ethnic group, a nation, to the public or common mass of people of a polity."
"As such it is a concept of human rights law, international law as well as constitutional law, particularly used for claims of popular sovereignty."
"A powder is a dry, bulk solid composed of many very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted."
"Powders are a special sub-class of granular materials, although the terms powder and granular are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material."
"In particular, powders refer to those granular materials that have the finer grain sizes, and that therefore have a greater tendency to form clumps when flowing."
Granulars refers to the coarser granular materials that do not tend to form clumps except when wet.
A clerk is a senior official of many municipal governments in the English-speaking world.
"In some communities, including most in the United States, the position is elected, but in many others, the clerk is appointed to their post."
"In the UK, a Town or Parish clerk is appointed by the Town or Parish Council Members."
"In almost all cases, the actual title of the clerk reflects the type of municipality they work for, thus, instead of simply being known as the clerk, the position is generally referred to as the town clerk, township clerk, city clerk, village clerk, borough clerk, board secretary, or county clerk."
"Other titles also exist, such as recorder."
"The office has existed for centuries, though in some places it is now being merged with other positions."
The duties of a municipal clerk vary even more than their titles.
"In the United Kingdom, a clerk is generally responsible for a Local Council (Town or Parish)."
"Particularly in the United States, it is difficult to fully describe a clerk's duties, because there are hundreds of different jobs a clerk may fulfill."
"In some U.S. states, there are provisions in the state constitutions delineating the clerk's duties, but in other states, each municipality decides for itself what role the clerk plays."
"Apple cider (also called sweet cider, soft cider, or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples."
"Though typically referred to simply as ""cider"" in the United States, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider in other places, which is called ""hard cider"" in the US."
"Outside of the United States and Canada, it is commonly referred to as cloudy apple juice to distinguish it from clearer, filtered apple juice and hard cider."
"Fresh liquid cider is extracted from the whole apple itself, including the apple core, trimmings from apples, and oddly sized or shaped “imperfect” apples, aka apple culls."
"Fresh cider is opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercially cooked and filtered apple juice, but this depends somewhat on the variety of apples used."
"Cider is sometimes pasteurized or exposed to UV light to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but traditional raw untreated cider is still common."
"Some companies have begun adding preservatives and boiling cider, so that it can be shelf stable and stored without refrigeration."
"In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn."
"It is traditionally served throughout autumn on the Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and various New Year's Eve holidays, sometimes heated and mulled."
A goose (PL: geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese and white geese) and Branta (the black geese).
"Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have ""goose"" as part of their names."
"More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller."
"The term ""goose"" may refer to either a male or female bird, but when paired with ""gander"",  refers specifically to a female one (the latter referring to a male)."
Young birds before fledging are called goslings.
"The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"Hitman is a stealth video game franchise developed by the Danish developer IO Interactive, and previously published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix."
"IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when Square Enix started seeking buyers for the studio."
"IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman, in June 2017."
"The games are available for macOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows and multiple consoles, including the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia (under the title Hitman: World of Assassination)."
"The series started with 2000's Hitman: Codename 47, and has featured eight main games in total, the most recent being Hitman 3, released January 2021."
"Main games in the Hitman series are set in semi-open world environments and presented from the third-person perspective, and have players eliminate specific targets assigned to them while trying to remain as stealthy as possible by various means; these include taking disguises, hiding from suspicious enemies, and using suppressed weaponry."
"The series' main protagonist and playable character is Agent 47, the eponymous hitman, who works for the fictional International Contract Agency (ICA)."
"Originating as a clone who was genetically-engineered to maintain peak human physicality and intelligence, be easy to control, and display a cold and monotone personality, 47 is regarded as the best assassin in the world."
"Although most of the Hitman games tend to tell their own independent narrative, there are several story arcs that span multiple games in the series, and each entry so far has been connected, even if loosely, to previous ones, creating a sense of continuity."
"Most of the storylines in the series revolve around 47 gradually unravelling and subsequently stopping a major conspiracy, while also developing his mysterious background, humane side, and relationships with various recurring characters."
The main games in the Hitman series have received generally positive reviews for their unique approach to stealth gameplay and highly competent artificial intelligence.
The franchise has shipped over 15 million copies worldwide as of 2015.
"Outside of the eight mainline games, the Hitman franchise also includes two spin-offs for mobile devices, Hitman Go (2014) and Hitman Sniper (2015); two novels, Hitman: Enemy Within (2007) by William C. Dietz, and Hitman: Damnation (2012) by Raymond Benson; a comic book miniseries, Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman, which serves as a prequel to the games; and two negatively received theatrical films, Hitman (2007) and Hitman: Agent 47 (2015), which share no narrative connections with the game series."
Lynching is an extrajudicial killing by a group.
"It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, punish a convicted transgressor, or intimidate."
"It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle (often in the form of hanging) for maximum intimidation."
"Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in every society.In the United States, where the word for ""lynching"" likely originated, lynchings of African Americans became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era, especially during the nadir of American race relations."
"Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food."
"Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose."
"Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond."
"Common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose)."
"Table sugar, granulated sugar, and regular sugar refer to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose."
"In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars."
"Longer chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars, and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides."
"Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, and is the most abundant source of energy in human food."
"Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar."
Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants.
Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of simple sugars.
"Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar."
"In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes."
Maltose may be produced by malting grain.
Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants.
"It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products."
"A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose."
Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g.
"cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available processed food and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g."
toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g.
coffee and tea).
"The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, with North and South Americans consuming up to 50 kilograms (110 lb) and Africans consuming under 20 kilograms (44 lb).As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health."
"Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tooth decay."
"Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar."
"In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake."
"A  hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted ""head"" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object."
"This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock."
"Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications."
"Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong)."
"Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with an secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook."
"Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc—downward to add kinetic energy to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring)."
"War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets."
Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes.
"Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip."
"The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic."
"Ubiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a ""claw"" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America."
"Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes."
"Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers."
"Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm."
"There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration."
"Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile."
"Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions."
"Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation."
A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use.
"Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft."
"The high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil."
"In terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight."
"For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area."
"It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids."
"A trench is a type of excavation or in the ground that is generally deeper than it is wide (as opposed to a wider gully, or ditch), and narrow compared with its length (as opposed to a simple hole or pit).In geology, trenches result from erosion by rivers or by geological movement of tectonic plates."
"In civil engineering, trenches are often created to install underground utilities such as gas, water, power and communication lines."
"In construction, trenches are dug for foundations of buildings, retaining walls and dams, and for cut-and-cover construction of tunnels."
"In archaeology, the ""trench method"" is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material."
"In geotechnical engineering, trenches serve for locating faults and investigating deep soil properties."
"In trench warfare, soldiers occupy trenches to protect them against weapons fire."
"Trenches are dug by use of manual tools such as shovels and pickaxes, or by heavy equipment such as backhoes, trenchers and excavators."
"For deep trenches, the instability of steep earthen walls requires engineering and safety techniques such as shoring."
"Trenches are usually considered temporary structures to be backfilled with soil after construction, or abandoned after use."
Some trenches are stabilized using durable materials such as concrete to create open passages such as canals and sunken roadways.
"A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other."
The lines usually run vertically and horizontally.
"A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is termed a saltire in heraldic terminology."
The cross in its various shapes and forms was a symbol of various beliefs.
In pre-Christian times it was a pagan religious symbol throughout Europe and western Asia.
"In ancient times, the effigy of a man hanging on a cross was set up in the fields to protect the crops."
"The cross was even considered a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; thus it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage, as in Egyptian amulet Nefer with male cross and female orb, considered as an amulet of blessedness, a charm of sexual harmony."
"Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film."
"It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects."
"Paint can be made or purchased in many colors—and in many different types, such as watercolor or synthetic."
"Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid."
Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics.
"For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers."
Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint.
Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.)
"Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 °C (50 °F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 °C (35 °F)."
An auto clicker is a type of software or macro that can be used to automate the clicking of a mouse on a computer screen element and click faster than intended.
"Clickers can be triggered to repeat input that was recorded earlier, or generated from various current settings."
Auto clickers can be as simple as a program that simulates mouse clicking.
This type of auto clicker is fairly generic and will often work alongside any other computer program running at the time and acting as though a physical mouse button is pressed.
"More complex auto clickers can similarly be as general, but often are custom-made for use with one particular program and involve memory reading."
"Such auto clickers may allow the user to automate most or all mouse functions, as well as simulate a full set of keyboard inputs."
Custom-made auto clickers may have a narrower scope than a generic auto clicker.
"Auto clickers also called automation software programs, may also have features enabling response conditional reactions, as well as a keyboard."
"A ship's company comprises all officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel aboard a naval vessel."
"The size of the ship's company (the complement) is the number of people on board, excluding civilians and guests."
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument.
"Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator."
"The strike may be made by an internal ""clapper"" or ""uvula"", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell)."
"Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials."
This depends on the function.
"Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal."
"Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower."
"Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters."
"Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services."
"Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom."
The study of bells is called campanology.
"An image (from Latin: imago) is an artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject—usually a physical object—and thus provides a depiction of it."
"In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s)."
"A pictorial script is a writing system that employs images as symbols for various semantic entities, rather than the abstract signs used by alphabets."
"In its most general sense, the term ""world"" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is."
The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
"Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a ""plurality of worlds""."
Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts.
"In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as ""[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be""."
"Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been."
"Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the ""horizon of all horizons""."
"In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind."
"Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent."
"In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice."
"A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview."
Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.
"In various contexts, the term ""world"" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope."
"In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents."
"Other examples include terms such as ""world religion"", ""world language"", ""world government"", ""world war"", ""world population"", ""world economy"" or ""world championship""."
"Internal control, as defined by accounting and auditing, is a process for assuring of an organization's objectives in operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with laws, regulations and policies."
"A broad concept, internal control involves everything that controls risks to an organization."
"It is a means by which an organization's resources are directed, monitored, and measured."
"It plays an important role in detecting and preventing fraud and protecting the organization's resources, both physical (e.g., machinery and property) and intangible (e.g., reputation or intellectual property such as trademarks)."
"At the organizational level, internal control objectives relate to the reliability of financial reporting, timely feedback on the achievement of operational or strategic goals, and compliance with laws and regulations."
"At the specific transaction level, internal controls refers to the actions taken to achieve a specific objective (e.g., how to ensure the organization's payments to third parties are for valid services rendered.)"
"Internal control procedures reduce process variation, leading to more predictable outcomes."
"Internal control is a key element of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which required improvements in internal control in United States public corporations."
Internal controls within business entities are also referred to as operational controls.
"The main controls in place are sometimes referred to as ""key financial controls"" (KFCs)."
"Naïve art is usually defined as visual art that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, art history, technique, perspective, ways of seeing)."
"When this aesthetic is emulated by a trained artist, the result is sometimes called primitivism, pseudo-naïve art, or faux naïve art.Unlike folk art, naïve art does not necessarily derive from a distinct popular cultural context or tradition;  indeed, at least in the advanced economies and since the Printing Revolution, awareness of the local fine art tradition has been inescapable, as it diffused through popular prints and other media."
"Naïve artists are aware of ""fine art"" conventions such as graphical perspective and compositional conventions, but are unable to fully use them, or choose not to."
"By contrast, outsider art (art brut) denotes works from a similar context but which have only minimal contact with the mainstream art world."
"Naïve art is recognized, and often imitated, for its childlike simplicity and frankness."
Paintings of this kind typically have a flat rendering style with a rudimentary expression of perspective.
"One particularly influential painter of ""naïve art"" was Henri Rousseau (1844–1910), a French Post-Impressionist who was discovered by Pablo Picasso."
"The definition of the term, and its ""borders"" with neighbouring terms such as folk art and outsider art, has been a matter of some controversy."
"Naïve art is a term usually used for the forms of fine art, such as paintings and sculptures, but made by a self-taught artist, while objects with a practical use come under folk art."
But this distinction has been disputed.
"Another term that may be used, especially of paintings and architecture, is ""provincial"", essentially used for work by artists who had received some conventional training, but whose work unintentionally falls short of metropolitan or court standards."
"A bra,  short for  brassiere or brassière (US: , UK:  or ; French: [bʁasjɛʁ]), is a form-fitting undergarment typically designed to support or cover a woman's breasts."
"Bras are designed for a variety of purposes, including general breast support, enhancing or diminishing the appearance of breast size and/or shape, creating cleavage, or other aesthetic or practical purposes."
"Swimsuits, camisoles, and backless dresses may have built-in breast support with supportive bra cups."
Nursing bras are designed to facilitate breastfeeding.
"Some people have a medical and surgical need for brassieres, but most wear them for fashion or cultural reasons."
Bras have gained importance beyond their mere functionality.
"Women's choices about what kind of bra to wear are consciously and unconsciously affected by social perceptions of the ideal female body shape, which changes over time."
Bras have become fashion items and cultural statements that are sometimes purposely revealed by the wearer or even worn as outerwear.
"Saly (also called Sali or Saly Portudal) is a seaside resort area in Thiès Region on the Petite Côte of Senegal, south of Dakar."
It is the top tourist destination in all of West Africa and has the status of a commune.
Blink of an Eye is the fourth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Michael McDonald.
"It was released on August 3, 1993, on the label Reprise, three years after his previous album, Take It to Heart."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"The number π (; spelled out as ""pi"") is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 3.14159."
"It is defined in Euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and also has various equivalent definitions."
The number appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics.
The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706.
"It is also referred to as Archimedes's constant.Being an irrational number, π cannot be expressed as a common fraction, although fractions such as 22/7 are commonly used to approximate it."
"Equivalently, its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanently repeating pattern."
"Its decimal (or other base) digits appear to be randomly distributed, and are conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness."
It is known that π is a transcendental number: it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.
The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge.
"Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations."
"Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy."
"In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematics approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematics made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques."
"The first computational formula for π, based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later, when the Madhava–Leibniz series was discovered by the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, documented in the Yuktibhāṣā, written around 1530.The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of π, enough for all practical scientific computations."
"Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of π to many trillions of digits."
"The primary motivation for these computations is as a test case to develop efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the quest to break records."
The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test supercomputers and high-precision multiplication algorithms.
"Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle, π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres."
"In more modern mathematical analysis, the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the real number system, as an eigenvalue or a period, without any reference to geometry."
"It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as number theory and statistics, as well as in almost all areas of physics."
The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants—both inside and outside the scientific community.
"Several books devoted to π have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines."
Tissue typing is a procedure in which the tissues of a prospective donor and recipient are tested for compatibility prior to transplantation.
Mismatched donor and recipient tissues can lead to rejection of the tissues.
There are multiple methods of tissue typing.
"Starting in the Middle Ages, a squire was the shield- or armour-bearer of a knight.Use of the term evolved over time."
"Initially, a squire was a knight's apprentice."
"Later, a village leader or a lord of the manor might be called a squire, and still later, the term was applied to members of the landed gentry."
"In contemporary American usage, squire is the title given to justices of the peace or similar local dignitaries.Squire is a shortened version of the word esquire,  from the Old French escuier (modern French écuyer), itself derived from the Late Latin scutarius (""shield bearer""), in medieval or Old English  a scutifer."
"The Classical Latin equivalent was armiger (""arms bearer"")."
Corn smut is a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis that causes smut on maize and teosinte.
The fungus forms galls on all above-ground parts of corn species.
"It is edible, and is known in Mexico as the delicacy huitlacoche; which is eaten, usually as a filling, in quesadillas and other tortilla-based foods, and in soups."
"Exoticism (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions and drew inspiration from them."
This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticisation'.
"Gaultheria shallon is an evergreen shrub in the heather family (Ericaceae), native to western North America."
"In English, it is known as salal, shallon, or simply gaultheria in Britain."
"In accounting, the controlling account (also known as an adjustment or control account) is an account in the general ledger for which a corresponding subsidiary ledger has been created."
The subsidiary ledger allows for tracking transactions within the controlling account in more detail.
"Individual transactions are posted both to the controlling account and the corresponding subsidiary ledger, and the totals for both are compared when preparing a trial balance to ensure accuracy."
"For example, ""accounts receivable"" is the controlling account for the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger."
"In this subsidiary ledger, each credit customer has their own account with its own balance."
"Thus, while the ""accounts receivable balance"" can report how much the company is owed, the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger can report how much is owed from each credit customer."
"Other examples of controlling accounts and their subsidiary ledgers include ""accounts payable"" (accounts payable subsidiary ledger) and ""equipment"" (equipment subsidiary ledger).In common use, control accounts refer to those that would, under ideal circumstances, balance to zero."
"For example, an inventory control account will hold the balance amount between a stock account updated by stock transactions on the balance sheet and the value of stock on hand multiplied by its unit cost."
Ideally these would be the same value but rarely are.
"Reasons for discrepancies include stock losses and gains yet to be ""journaled"" and the control account measures the differences and provides financial visibility and control of the value of those."
"If the discrepancy is significant, then actions such as stock counts can be triggered in order to validate stock and correct the balance sheet and clear the control account."
"Other examples would be the ""goods received not invoiced"" account."
"Allium ursinum, known as wild garlic, ramsons, wild cowleek, cowlic, buckrams, broad-leaved garlic, wood garlic, bear leek or bear's garlic, is a bulbous perennial flowering plant in the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae."
"It is native to Europe and Asia, where it grows in moist woodland."
"It is a wild relative of onion and garlic, all belonging to the same genus, Allium."
There are two recognized subspecies: A. ursinum subsp.
ursinum and A. ursinum subsp.
ucranicum.
"A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural."
"Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources."
"Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature."
"The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery."
"At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes."
"Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to ""enchanted"" or ""magical""."
"It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy."
A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms.
"Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food."
"Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps."
"Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities."
"In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras."
The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally."
"In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly orange yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal."
"Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element."
It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.
"Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits."
"It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite."
"Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides)."
"Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion."
"Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term acid test."
"Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating."
"Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction."
"A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history."
"In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971."
"A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020."
This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft).
"The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
"Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use)."
"Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration."
Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.
"As of 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year."
"A cup is an open-top container used to hold or cold liquids for pouring or drinking; while mainly used for drinking, it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains, salt)."
"Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments."
"Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations."
Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g.
"teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g."
"at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals),or for decoration."
A name is a term used for identification by an external observer.
"They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context."
The entity identified by a name is called its referent.
"A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human."
"The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun."
"Other nouns are sometimes called ""common names"" or (obsolete) ""general names""."
"A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name."
Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived by the human eye.
"Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).In physics, the term ""light"" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not."
"In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light."
"The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization."
"Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is one of the fundamental constants of nature."
"Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles."
"The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics."
The main source of light on Earth is the Sun.
"Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps."
"With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight."
"Wool is the textile fibre obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, hide and fur clothing from bison, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.Wool consists of protein together with a small percentage of lipids."
"In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from cotton, which is mainly cellulose."
"A clothes line or washing line is any type of rope, cord, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g."
"two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground."
"Clothing that has recently been  washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins."
"Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies."
Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing.
"More elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape, with multiple lines being used (such as the Hills Hoist from Australia)."
"Some can be folded up when not in use (although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught, so there is usually a safety button)."
"In Scotland, many tenement buildings have a ""drying green"", which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines – it may also be used as a recreational space - as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather."
"The Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Underwood Tariff or the Underwood-Simmons Act (ch."
"16, 38 Stat."
"114), re-established a federal income tax in the United States and substantially lowered tariff rates."
"The act was sponsored by Representative Oscar Underwood, passed by the 63rd United States Congress, and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson."
"Wilson and other members of the Democratic Party had long seen high tariffs as equivalent to unfair taxes on consumers, and tariff reduction was President Wilson's first priority upon taking office."
"Following the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, Democratic leaders agreed to seek passage of a major bill that would dramatically lower tariffs and implement an income tax."
"Underwood quickly shepherded the revenue bill through the House of Representatives, but the bill won approval in the United States Senate only after extensive lobbying by the Wilson administration."
"Wilson signed the bill into law on October 3, 1913."
The Revenue Act of 1913 lowered average tariff rates from 40 percent to 26 percent.
"It also established a one percent tax on income above $3,000 per year; the tax affected approximately three percent of the population."
"A separate provision established a corporate tax of one percent, superseding a previous tax that had only applied to corporations with net incomes greater than $5,000 per year."
"Though a Republican-controlled Congress would later raise tariff rates, the Revenue Act of 1913 marked an important shift in federal revenue policy, as government revenue would increasingly rely on income taxes rather than tariff duties."
"Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy."
"On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere."
"Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time."
"When used without qualification, ""weather"" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth."
"Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another."
"These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude."
"The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream."
"Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow."
"Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year."
"On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually."
"Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change."
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.
"Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant."
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.
"Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole."
"Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth."
"A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years."
"However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies."
"A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System."
The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.
Jungle warfare is a term used to cover the special techniques needed for military units to survive and fight in jungle terrain.
"It has been the topic of extensive study by military strategists, and was an important part of the planning for both sides in many conflicts, including World War II and the Vietnam War."
The jungle has a variety of effects on military operations.
"Dense vegetation can limit lines of sight and arcs of fire, but can also provide ample opportunity for camouflage and plenty of material with which to build fortifications."
"Jungle terrain, often without good roads, can be inaccessible to vehicles and so makes logistical supply and transport difficult, which in turn places a premium on air mobility."
"The problems of transport make engineering resources important as they are needed to improve roads, build bridges and airfields, and improve water supplies."
"Jungle environments can also be inherently unhealthy, with various tropical diseases that have to be prevented or treated by medical services."
"Likewise the terrain can make it difficult to deploy armoured forces, or any other kind of forces on any large scale."
Successful jungle fighting emphasises effective small unit tactics and leadership.
"Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits whose main preserving agent is sugar and sometimes acid, often stored in glass jars and used as a condiment or spread."
"There are many varieties of fruit preserves globally, distinguished by method of preparation, type of fruit used, and place in a meal."
"Sweet fruit preserves such as jams, jellies and marmalades are often eaten at breakfast on bread or as an ingredient of a pastry or dessert, whereas more savory and acidic preserves made from ""vegetable fruits"" such as tomato, squash or zucchini, are eaten alongside savoury foods such as cheese, cold meats, and curries."
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) is a name used by various paramilitary organisations in Ireland throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.
"Organisations going by this name have been dedicated to irredentism through Irish republicanism, the belief that all of Ireland should be an independent republic free from British rule.The original Irish Republican Army (1919–1922), often now referred to as the ""old IRA"", was raised in 1917 from members of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, later reinforced by Irishmen, formerly in the British Army in World War I, who returned to Ireland to fight against Britain in the Irish War of Independence."
"In Irish law, this IRA was the army of the revolutionary Irish Republic as declared by its parliament, Dáil Éireann, in 1919."
"In the century that followed, the original IRA was reorganised, changed and split on multiple occasions, to such a degree that many subsequent paramilitary organisations have been known by that title – most notably the Provisional Irish Republican Army which was a key participant during the Troubles."
"The contemporary IRA organisations each claim the sole right to use that name, as they each insist they are the only legitimate descendants of the original IRA."
Nick is a masculine given name.
"It is  also often encountered as a short form (hypocorism) of the given names Nicholas, Nicola,  Nicolas, Nikola, Nicolai or Nicodemus."
It may refer to:
"The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake."
"The Earth has around  620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline."
"Coasts are important zones in natural ecosystems, often home to a wide range of biodiversity."
"On land, they harbor important ecosystems such as freshwater or estuarine wetlands, which are important for bird populations and other terrestrial animals."
"In wave-protected areas they harbor saltmarshes, mangroves or seagrasses, all of which can provide nursery habitat for finfish, shellfish, and other aquatic species."
Rocky shores are usually found along exposed coasts and provide habitat for a wide range of sessile animals (e.g.
"mussels, starfish, barnacles) and various kinds of seaweeds."
"Along tropical coasts with clear, nutrient-poor water, coral reefs can often be found between depths of 1 – 50 m.
According to a United Nations atlas, 44% of all people live within 150 km (93 mi) of the sea."
"Because of their importance in society and high concentration of population, the coast is important for major parts of the global food and economic system, and they provide many ecosystem services to humankind."
"For example, important human activities happen in port cities."
"Coastal fisheries (commercial, recreational, and subsistence) and aquaculture are major economic activities and create jobs, livelihoods, and protein for the majority of coastal human populations."
Other coastal spaces like beaches and seaside resorts generate large revenues through tourism.
Coastal ecosystems can also provide protection against sea level rise and tsunamis.
"In many countries, mangroves are the primary source of wood for fuel (e.g."
charcoal) and building material.
"Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses have a much higher capacity for carbon sequestration than many terrestrial ecosystems, and as such can play a critical role in the near-future to help mitigate climate change effects by uptake of atmospheric anthropogenic carbon dioxide."
"However, the economic importance of coasts makes many of these communities vulnerable to climate change which causes increases in extreme weather and sea level rise, and related issues such as coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding."
"Other coastal issues, such as marine pollution, marine debris, coastal development, and marine ecosystem destruction, further complicate the human uses of the coast and threaten coastal ecosystems."
"The interactive effects of climate change, habitat destruction, overfishing and water pollution (especially eutrophication) have led to the demise of coastal ecosystem around the globe."
"This has resulted in population collapse of fisheries stocks, loss of biodiversity, increased invasion of alien species, and loss of heathy habitats."
"International attention to these issues has been captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 ""Life Below Water"" which sets goals for international policy focused on preserving coastal ecosystems and supporting more sustainable economic practices for coastal communities."
"Likewise, the United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, but restoration of coastal ecosystems has received insufficient attention.Because coasts are constantly changing, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined; this measurement challenge is called the coastline paradox."
The term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur.
"Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East, West, and Gulf Coast of the United States.)"
"Coasts with a narrow continental shelf that are close to the open ocean are called pelagic coast, while other coasts are more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay."
"A shore, on the other hand, may refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and lakes (lake shore)."
"A sneeze (also known as sternutation) is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa."
"A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action."
This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity.
"Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light, sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, exposure to allergens, or viral infection."
"Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while sneezing."
"In addition to covering the mouth, looking down is also recommended in order to change the direction of the droplets spread and avoid high concentration in the human breathing heights."
The function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity.
"During a sneeze, the soft palate and palatine uvula depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth, creating a venturi (similar to a carburetor) due to Bernoulli's principle so that air ejected from the lungs is accelerated through the mouth and thus creating a low pressure point at the back of the nose."
This way air is forced in through the front of the nose and the expelled mucus and contaminants are launched out the mouth.
"Sneezing with the mouth closed does expel mucus through the nose but is not recommended because it creates a very high pressure in the head and is potentially harmful, blocking a sneeze entirely may even prove fatal.Sneezing cannot occur during sleep due to REM atonia – a bodily state where motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain."
"Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from sleep to sneeze, but any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum."
"A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface."
"On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater."
"For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates."
"Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America."
"Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth."
"This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example."
Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.
Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool the Earth's  troposphere.
"Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines."
A comptroller is a management-level position responsible for supervising the quality of accounting and financial reporting of an organization.
"A financial comptroller is a senior-level executive who acts as the head of accounting, and oversees the preparation of financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements."
"In most Commonwealth countries, the comptroller general, auditor general, or comptroller and auditor general is the external auditor of the budget execution of the government and of government-owned companies."
"Typically, the independent institution headed by the comptroller general is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions."
"In American government, the comptroller is effectively the chief financial officer of a public body."
"In business management, the comptroller is closer to a chief audit executive, holding a senior role in internal audit functions."
"Generally, the title encompasses a variety of responsibilities, from overseeing accounting and monitoring internal controls to countersigning on expenses and commitments."
"Silver is a chemical element with the symbol Ag (from the Latin argentum, derived from the Proto-Indo-European h₂erǵ: ""shiny"" or ""white"") and atomic number 47."
"A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal."
"The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (""native silver""), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite."
"Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining."
Silver has long been valued as a precious metal.
"Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal."
"Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as ""0.940 fine""."
"As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures."
"Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term ""silverware""), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized confectionery."
Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film.
"Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments."
"Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view—with its elements arranged into a coherent composition."
"In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work."
"Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition."
"Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects."
"Two main traditions spring from Western painting and Chinese art, going back well over a thousand years in both cases."
"The recognition of a spiritual element in landscape art is present from its beginnings in East Asian art, drawing on Daoism and other philosophical traditions, but in the West only becomes explicit with Romanticism."
"Landscape views in art may be entirely imaginary, or copied from reality with varying degrees of accuracy."
"If the primary purpose of a picture is to depict an actual, specific place, especially including buildings prominently, it is called a topographical view."
"Such views, extremely common as prints in the West, are often seen as inferior to fine art landscapes, although the distinction is not always meaningful; similar prejudices existed in Chinese art, where literati painting usually depicted imaginary views, while professional artists painted real views.The word ""landscape"" entered the modern English language as landskip (variously spelt), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works of art, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598."
"Within a few decades it was used to describe vistas in poetry, and eventually as a term for real views."
"However the cognate term landscaef or landskipe for a cleared patch of land had existed in Old English, though it is not recorded from Middle English."
"A hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water."
They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes.
Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils.
"As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds."
"Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults."
All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order Urodela.
"Salamander diversity is highest in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic realm, with some species present in the Neotropical realm."
"Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs."
"Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places."
"Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults."
They are capable of regenerating lost limbs as well as other damaged parts of their bodies.
"Researchers hope to reverse engineer the remarkable regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during heart surgery recovery.Members of the family Salamandridae are mostly known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies typical of other groups."
The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity.
"Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles."
Some species in harsh environments reproduce while still in the larval state.
"1 (one, also called unit, and unity) is a number and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals."
"It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement."
"For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1."
"In conventions of sign where zero is considered neither positive nor negative, 1 is the first and smallest positive integer."
"It is also sometimes considered the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by 2, although by other definitions 1 is the second natural number, following 0."
"The fundamental mathematical property of 1 is to be a multiplicative identity, meaning that any number multiplied by 1 equals the same number."
Most if not all properties of 1 can be deduced from this.
"In advanced mathematics, a multiplicative identity is often denoted 1, even if it is not a number."
"1 is by convention not considered a prime number; although universally accepted today, this fact was controversial until the mid-20th century."
"The unique mathematical properties of the number have led to its unique uses in other fields, ranging from science to sports."
"It commonly denotes the first, leading or top thing in a group."
"A wet wipe, also known as a wet towel or a moist towelette, disposable wipe, disinfecting wipe, or a baby wipe (in specific circumstances), is a small to medium-sized moistened piece of plastic or cloth that either comes folded and individually wrapped for convenience or, in the case of dispensers, as a large roll with individual wipes that can be torn off."
Wet wipes are used for cleaning purposes like personal hygiene and household cleaning; each is a separate product depending on the chemicals added and medical or office cleaning wipes are not intended for skin hygiene.
"In 2013, owing to increasing popularity of the product in affluent countries, Consumer Reports reported that efforts to make the wipes ""flushable"" down the toilet had not entirely succeeded, according to their test."
"A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water."
"The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers."
"The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand."
Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well.
"Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India."
"Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age."
"Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world."
"These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds."
A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole.
"Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water."
"Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole."
Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic.
Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
"Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath."
A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material.
"The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor."
Water may be pumped or hand drawn.
Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided.
Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable.
Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out.
Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.
Scissors are hand-operated shearing tools.
A pair of scissors consists of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed.
"Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire."
A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes.
"Hair-cutting shears and kitchen shears are functionally equivalent to scissors, but the larger implements tend to be called shears."
Hair-cutting shears have specific blade angles ideal for cutting hair.
"Using the incorrect type of scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair."
"Kitchen shears, also known as kitchen scissors, are intended for cutting and trimming foods such as meats."
Modern scissors are often designed ergonomically with composite thermoplastic and rubber handles which enable the user to exert either a power grip or a precision grip.
"A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers."
In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz).
"Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled."
"The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole."
Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (cf.
cube steak).
This is a partial list of human eye diseases and disorders.
"The World Health Organization publishes a classification of known diseases and injuries, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD-10."
This list uses that classification.
"A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural orbital period of the Moon; the words month and Moon are cognates."
"The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (""lunations"") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days."
"From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age."
"Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year."
"Natural childbirth is childbirth without routine medical interventions, particularly anesthesia."
Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies.
"Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as episiotomies, forceps and ventouse deliveries and caesarean sections."
"Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended hospital birth, a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth."
"The term ""natural childbirth"" was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read upon publication of his book Natural Childbirth in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 Childbirth Without Fear."
Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties.
"It borders Greater London to the north-west, Surrey to the west and East Sussex to the south-west, and Essex to the north across the estuary of the River Thames; it faces the French department of Pas-de-Calais across the Strait of Dover."
The county town is Maidstone.
"It is the fifth most populous county in England, the most populous non-Metropolitan county and the most populous of the home counties."
"Kent was one of the first British territories to be settled by Germanic tribes, most notably the Jutes, following the withdrawal of the Romans."
"Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, the oldest cathedral in England, has been the seat of the Archbishops of Canterbury since the conversion of England to Christianity that began in the 6th century with Saint Augustine."
Rochester Cathedral in Medway is England's second-oldest cathedral.
"Located between London and the Strait of Dover, which separates England from mainland Europe, Kent has been the setting for both conflict and diplomacy, including the Battle of Britain in World War II and the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004."
England relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 10th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance.
France can be seen clearly in fine weather from Folkestone and the White Cliffs of Dover.
Hills in the form of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge span the length of the county and in the Vale of Holmesdale in between and to the south are most of the county's 26 castles.
"Kent's economy is greatly diversified: agriculture, haulage, logistics and tourism are major industries."
"Because of its relative abundance of fruit-growing and hop gardens, Kent is known as ""The Garden of England""."
"In northwest Kent, industries include extraction of aggregate building materials, printing and scientific research."
Coal mining has also played its part in Kent's industrial heritage.
Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt and its strong transport connections to the capital and the nearby continent make Kent a high-income county.
Twenty-eight per cent of the county forms part of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the North Downs and The High Weald.
An oil well is a boring in the Earth that is designed to bring petroleum oil hydrocarbons to the surface.
Usually some natural gas is released as associated petroleum gas along with the oil.
A well that is designed to produce only gas may be termed a gas well.
Wells are created by drilling down into an oil or gas reserve that is then mounted with an extraction device such as a pumpjack which allows extraction from the reserve.
"Creating the wells can be an expensive process, costing at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, and costing much more when in hard to reach areas, i.e."
when creating offshore oil platforms.
"The process of modern drilling for wells first started in the 19th century, but was made more efficient with advances to oil drilling rigs during the 20th century."
"Wells are frequently sold or exchanged between different oil and gas companies as an asset – in large part because during falls in price of oil and gas, a well may be unproductive, but if prices rise, even low production wells may be economically valuable."
"Moreover new methods, such as hydraulic fracturing (a process of injecting gas or liquid to force more oil or natural gas production) have made some wells viable."
"However, peak oil and climate policy to  fossil fuels has made fewer and fewer of these wells and expensive techniques viable."
"However, the large number of neglected or poorly maintained wellheads is a large environmental issue: they may leak methane emissions or other toxic emissions into local air, water or soil systems."
"This pollution often becomes worse when wells are abandoned or orphaned – where wells no longer are economically viable, and no longer are maintained by a company."
"A 2020 estimate by Reuters suggested that there were at least 29 million abandoned wells internationally, creating a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change."
"Parenting or child rearing promotes and supports the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood."
"Parenting refers to the intricacies of raising a child and not exclusively for a biological relationship.The most common caretaker in parenting is the father or mother, or both, the biological parents of the child in question."
"However, a surrogate may be an older sibling, a step-parent, a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle, other family members, or a family friend."
Governments and society may also have a role in child-rearing.
"In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent or non-blood relations."
"Others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage."
"Parenting skills vary, and a parent or surrogate with good parenting skills may be referred to as a good parent.Parenting styles vary by historical period, race/ethnicity, social class, preference, and a few other social features."
"Additionally, research supports that parental history, both in terms of attachments of varying quality and parental psychopathology, particularly in the wake of adverse experiences, can strongly influence parental sensitivity and child outcomes."
A father is the male parent of a child.
"Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations."
An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption.
"A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation."
"A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support."
A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
"A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child."
"The adjective ""paternal"" refers to a father and comparatively to ""maternal"" for a mother."
"The verb ""to father"" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun ""fathering""."
"Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male)."
"Related terms of endearment are dad (dada, daddy), baba, papa, pappa, papasita, (pa, pap) and pop."
A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.
A locket is a pendant that opens to reveal a space used for storing a photograph or other small item such as a lock of hair.
"Lockets are usually given to loved ones on holidays such as Valentine's Day and occasions such as christenings, weddings and, most noticeably during the Victorian Age, funerals."
"Historically, they often opened to reveal a portrait miniature."
"Lockets are generally worn on chains around the neck and often hold a photo of the person who gave the locket, or they could form part of a charm bracelet."
"They come in many shapes such as ovals, hearts and circles and are usually made of precious metals such as gold or silver befitting their status as decorative jewellery."
"Lockets usually hold only one or two photographs, but some specially made lockets can hold up to eight."
"Some lockets have been fashioned as 'spinner' lockets, where the bail that attaches to the necklace chain is attached but not fixed to the locket itself which is free to spin."
This was a common style in the Victorian Age.
Around 1860 memento lockets started to replace mourning rings as the preferred style of mourning jewellery.Keepsake lockets can also be made with a glass pane at the front so that what is inside can be seen without opening the locket.
"Such lockets are generally used for items like locks of hair which could fall out and become lost if the locket were repeatedly opened, whereas photograph lockets are generally enclosed on all sides and the photographs are secured by pieces of clear plastic."
Another kind of locket still made was in a filigree style with a small cushion in the centre to which a few drops of perfume should be added.
Perfume lockets  were popular in eras when personal hygiene was restricted and sweet smelling perfume was used to mask the odour of a person or their companions.
"Very rare World War I- and World War II-era British and American military uniform locket buttons exist, containing miniature working compasses."
Neil is a masculine name of Irish origin.
The name is an Anglicisation of the Irish Niall which is of disputed derivation.
"The Irish name may be derived from words meaning ""cloud"", ""passionate"", ""victory"", ""honour"" or ""champion""."
"As a surname, Neil is traced back to Niall of the Nine Hostages who was an Irish king and eponymous ancestor of the Uí Néill and MacNeil kindred."
"Most authorities cite the meaning of Neil in the context of a surname as meaning ""champion""."
A wetsuit is a garment worn to provide thermal protection while wet.
"It is usually made of foamed neoprene, and is worn by surfers, divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water."
"Its purpose is to provide thermal insulation and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure, and stings from marine organisms."
It also contributes extra buoyancy.
"The insulation properties of neoprene foam depend mainly on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat."
"The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water."
"Hugh Bradner, a University of California, Berkeley physicist, invented the modern wetsuit in 1952."
"Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later spandex (also known as lycra)."
"Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing, the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside."
"Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a ""semi-dry""."
Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures.
"Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) ""shortie"", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood."
"The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, though good fit limits water circulation inside the suit, and between the inside and outside of the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness."
Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters.
"Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to use, but can be used where protection from lower temperatures or contaminated water is needed."
Coccinellidae () is a widespread family of small beetles ranging in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (0.03 to 0.71 in).
The family is commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain and other parts of the English-speaking world.
"Entomologists prefer the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects are not classified as true bugs.The majority of coccinellid species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many species prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests."
Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source.
"However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves."
"Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are in fewer numbers."
"In such situations, they can do major crop damage."
They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.
"A cactus (plural cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales."
"The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain."
Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes.
"Although some species live in quite humid environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought."
"Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth."
Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water.
"Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water."
"Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place."
"Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves."
"As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade."
"In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis."
"Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka."
"Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch."
Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti.
"As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled."
"Many cacti have  short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface."
"Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods."
"Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called ""crassulacean acid metabolism"" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis."
"Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night."
"The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis."
"Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced."
"Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration."
"The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft), and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity."
A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm.
A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family.
"At least superficially, plants of the genera Leuenbergeria, Rhodocactus and Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them."
"They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems."
"Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation."
Leuenbergeria is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved.
"In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees)."
"Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera)."
"Cacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit)."
Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.
"Many succulent plants in both the Old and New World – such as some Euphorbiaceae (euphorbias) – are also spiny stem succulents and because of this are sometimes incorrectly referred to as ""cactus""."
"A working paper or work paper may be: 

A preliminary scientific or technical paper."
"Often, authors will release working papers to share ideas about a topic or to elicit feedback before submitting to a peer reviewed conference or academic journal."
"Working papers are often the basis for related works, and may in themselves be cited by peer-review papers."
They may be considered as grey literature.
Sometimes the term working paper is used synonymously as technical report.
"Working papers are typically hosted on websites, belonging either to the author or the author's affiliated institution."
"The United Nations uses the term ""working paper"" in approximately this sense for the draft of a resolution."
Documents required for a minor to get a job in certain states within the United States.
"Such papers usually require the employer, parent/guardian, school, and a physician to agree to the terms of work laid out by the employer."
Audit working papers: Documents required on an audit of a company's financial statements.
The working papers are the property of the accounting firm conducting the audit.
These papers are formally referred to as Audit Documentation or sometimes as the audit file.
"The documents serve as proof of audit procedures performed, evidence obtained and the conclusion or opinion the auditor reached (AU 339.05)."
"For more information, see AS 3 and AU 339 or www.aicpa.org."
"A structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized."
"Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals."
Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form.
"Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space."
"Junker (Danish: Junker, German: Junker, Dutch: Jonkheer, English: Yunker, Norwegian: Junker, Swedish: Junker Georgian: იუნკერი (Iunkeri)) is a noble honorific, derived from Middle High German Juncherre, meaning ""young nobleman"" or otherwise ""young lord"" (derivation of jung and Herr)."
"The term is traditionally used throughout the German-speaking, Dutch-speaking and Scandinavian-speaking parts of Europe."
"It also was used in the Russian Empire due to Baltic German influence, up until the Russian Revolution."
"The term is currently still in use by the Georgian Defense Forces, for Student officers of the Military Academy, who are being prepared to serve in the army as senior Officers."
"The First Battle of Bull Run (the name used by Union forces), also known as the Battle of First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces), was the first major battle of the American Civil War."
"The battle was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of the city of Manassas and about 30 miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C."
"The Union's forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail."
"Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle."
"It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces."
"Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the  Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy."
"Yielding to political pressure, Brig."
Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig.
Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction.
"McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage."
Confederate reinforcements under Brig.
"Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed."
"A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, ""Stonewall""."
"The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout."
"McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C."
Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and the many casualties and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated.
The First Battle of Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war.
"Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was minimal, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively."
"McDowell, with 35,000 men, could commit only about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, also committed 18,000."
"Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti] (listen)), is a transcontinental country located mainly on Anatolia in Western Asia, with a portion on the Balkans in Southeast Europe."
"It shares borders with Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea to the west."
Cyprus is located off the south coast.
Turks form the vast majority of the nation's population and Kurds are the largest minority.
"Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre."
"One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks and others."
"Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions in modern Turkey were culturally Hellenised, which continued during the Byzantine era."
"The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities."
"Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period."
"After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I."
"During the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global power."
"From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power declined with a gradual loss of territories."
Mahmud II started a period of modernisation in the early 19th century.
"The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party period."
"The 1913 coup d'état put the country under the control of the Three Pashas, who facilitated the Empire's entry into World War I as part of the Central Powers in 1914."
"During the war, the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek and Assyrian subjects."
"After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was partitioned.The Turkish War of Independence against the occupying Allied Powers resulted in the abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July 1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923."
"With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic."
Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952.
The country endured several military coups in the latter half of the 20th century.
"The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability."
The parliamentary republic was replaced with a presidential system by referendum in 2017.
"Since then, the new Turkish governmental system under president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his party, the AKP, has often been described as Islamist and authoritarian."
"The latter's rule over the country has also led to numerous currency crises, increasing inflation and economic decline, as well as a rise in poverty.Turkey is a regional power and a newly industrialized country, with a geopolitically strategic location."
"Its economy, which is classified among the emerging and growth-leading economies, is the twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the eleventh-largest by PPP."
"It is a charter member of the United Nations, an early member of NATO, the IMF, and the World Bank, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC, and G20."
"After becoming one of the early members of the Council of Europe in 1950, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995, and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005."
"""Carol of the Bells"" is a popular Christmas carol, with music by Ukrainian composer Mykola Leontovych in 1914 and lyrics by Peter J. Wilhousky."
"The song is based on the Ukrainian folk chant ""Shchedryk""."
"The music is in the public domain, Wilhousky's lyrics are however under copyright protection (owned by Carl Fischer Music)."
"The music is based on a four-note ostinato and is in 34 time signature, with the B-flat bell pealing in 68 time."
"The carol is metrically bistable, and a listener can focus on either measure or switch between them."
"It has been adapted for many genres, including: classical, metal, jazz, country music, rock, trap, and pop."
"The piece also features in films, television shows, and parodies."
The Messier objects are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles (Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters).
"Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them."
"The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as the Messier catalogue."
"This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier number."
The catalogue includes most of the astronomical deep-sky objects that can easily be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere; many Messier objects are popular targets for amateur astronomers.A preliminary version first appeared in 1774 in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771.
The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects which were not yet numbered.
"Eighteen of the objects were discovered by Messier, the rest being previously observed by other astronomers."
By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects.
The final version of the catalogue containing 103 objects was published in 1781 in the Connaissance des Temps for the year 1784.
"However, due to what was thought for a long time to be the incorrect addition of Messier 102, the total number remained 102."
"Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list up to 110 objects.The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies."
"For example, Messier 1 is a supernova remnant, known as the Crab Nebula, and the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy is M 31."
"Further inclusions followed, the first addition came from Nicolas Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue."
"M 105 to M 107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947, M 108 and M 109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960, and M 110 by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967."
"A circus is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, dancers, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, magicians, ventriloquists, and unicyclists as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists."
The term circus also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history.
"Although not the inventor of the medium, Philip Astley is credited as the father of the modern circus."
"In 1768, Astley, a skilled equestrian, began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha'Penny Hatch on the south side of the Thames River."
"In 1770, he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a ""circus""."
"Performances developed significantly over the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature."
"The traditional format, in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and remained the dominant format until the 1970s."
"As styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed."
The earliest modern circuses were performed in open-air structures with limited covered seating.
"From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage."
"The traditional large tents commonly known as ""big tops"" were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues."
These tents eventually became the most common venue.
"Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos."
"Many circus performances are still held in a ring, usually 13 m (42 ft) in diameter."
This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.
"Contemporary circus has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry."
"Circuses within the movement have tended to favour a theatrical approach, combining character-driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories."
"Contemporary circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills, techniques, and stylistic influences from other performing arts."
"The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems."
"As a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours."
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
"Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol."
"The unit of measurement ""day"" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds."
The second is designated the SI base unit of time.
"Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition."
"A civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time."
"Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis."
"However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next."
"For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word ""daytime"" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear."
"The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, ""On which day?"""
The biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface.
"Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth."
"The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect)."
"Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations."
"In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can prevail."
"Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction, the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect."
Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy.
"The wind is also a critical means of transportation for seeds, insects, and birds, which can travel on wind currents for thousands of miles."
"In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing."
Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts.
Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls.
"Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane."
"In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space."
The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.
"In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology, influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation."
Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans.
"Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption."
Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft.
"When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed."
"Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, for example loess, and by erosion."
Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions.
Wind also affects the spread of wildfires.
"Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations."
"When combined with cold temperatures, the wind has a negative impact on livestock."
"Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies."
"A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or even another bay."
"A large bay is usually called a gulf, sea, sound, or bight."
"A cove is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance."
A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.
"A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary of the Susquehanna River."
"Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada."
"Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology."
The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves.
Bays may have as wide a variety of shoreline characteristics as other shorelines.
"In some cases, bays have beaches, which ""are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace""."
Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for fishing.
Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports.
"Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or hachis Parmentier  is a dish consisting of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato."
"Its defining ingredients are red meat and onions in gravy or sauce, with a topping of mashed potato."
Common variants include adding vegetables to the filling and topping the dish with cheese.
The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.
It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.
"In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails."
"A railroad worm is a larva or larviform female adult of a beetle of the genus Phrixothrix in the family Phengodidae, characterized by the possession of two different colors of bioluminescence."
It has the appearance of a caterpillar.
"The eleven pairs of luminescent organs on their second thoracic segment through their ninth abdominal segment can glow yellowish-green, while the pair on their head can glow red; this is due to different luciferases in their bodies, as the reaction substrate, called luciferin, is the same.The ""railroad worm"" name arises because these glowing spots along the body resemble the windows of train cars internally illuminated in the night."
"The light emissions are believed to be a warning signal to nocturnal predators of their unpalatability.The term ""railroad worm"" is also sometimes applied to the apple maggot."
"Drywall (also known as plasterboard, wallboard, sheet rock, gypsum board, buster board, custard board, or gypsum panel) is a panel made of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), with or without additives, typically extruded between thick sheets of facer and backer paper, used in the construction of interior walls and ceilings."
"The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper, glass wool, or a combination of these materials), plasticizer, foaming agent, and various additives that can reduce mildew, flammability, and water absorption."
"In the mid-20th century, drywall construction became prevalent in North America as a time- and labor-saving alternative to traditional lath and plaster."
"Langaha madagascariensis (formerly Langaha nasuta, commonly known as the Madagascar or Malagasy leaf-nosed snake) is a medium-sized highly cryptic arboreal species."
"It is endemic to Madagascar and found in deciduous dry forests and rain forests, often in vegetation 1.5 to 2 meters above the ground."
Celery (Apium graveolens) is a marshland plant in the family Apiaceae that has been cultivated as a vegetable since antiquity.
Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves.
"Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves or hypocotyl are eaten and used in cooking."
Celery seed powder is used as a spice.
"A balcony (from Italian: balcone, ""scaffold"") is a platform projecting from the wall of a building, supported by columns or console brackets, and enclosed with a balustrade, usually above the ground floor."
Carnival is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent.
"The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent)."
"Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus."
Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity.
"Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent."
"Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed ""excessively"", rather, their stock was fully consumed as to reduce waste."
"This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, and various other activities of indulgence being performed."
"For example, Pancakes, donuts, and other desserts were prepared and eaten for a final time."
"During Lent, animal products are eaten less, and individuals have the ability to make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire."
"Other common features of Carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social satire; mockery of authorities; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms."
"The Italian tradition of wearing masks dates back to the Venice Carnival in the 15th century, and has been an inspiration in Greek theater and Commedia dell'arte for centuries.The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece."
"In historically Evangelical Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras."
"In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent."
"In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.)."
This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.
"Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker."
Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.
"Bruges ( BROOZH, Dutch: Brugge [ˈbrʏɣə] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of West Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium, in the northwest of the country, and the seventh-largest city of the country by population."
"The area of the whole city amounts to more than 13,840 hectares (138.4 km2; 53.44 sq miles), including 1,075 hectares off the coast, at Zeebrugge (from Brugge aan zee, meaning 'Bruges by the Sea')."
The historic city centre is a prominent World Heritage Site of UNESCO.
It is oval in shape and about 430 hectares in size.
"The city's total population is 117,073 (1 January 2008), of whom around 20,000 live in the city centre."
"The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of 616 km2 (238 sq mi) and has a total of 255,844 inhabitants as of 1 January 2008.Along with a few other canal-based northern cities, such as Amsterdam and St Petersburg, it is sometimes referred to as the Venice of the North."
"Bruges has a significant economic importance, thanks to its port, and was once one of the world's chief commercial cities."
"Bruges is a popular tourism destination within Belgium, and is well known as the seat of the College of Europe, a university institute for European studies."
Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization.
"In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top."
"In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators""."
"In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content."
"It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making."
"Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy""."
"In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on."
"Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet, bitter, salty and tangy dishes."
"Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream."
This is also the origin of butter's yellow color.
"Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white."
"A patrol is commonly a group of personnel, such as law enforcement officers, military personnel, or private security contractors that are assigned to monitor a specific geographic area."
This is also often referred to as a beat.
"British Columbia (commonly abbreviated as BC; French: Colombie-Britannique) is the westernmost province of Canada, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains."
"With an estimated population of 5.2 million as of 2021, it is Canada's third-most populous province."
"The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada, named for Queen Victoria, who reigned over the British Empire at the time of Confederation."
"The largest city is Vancouver, the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada, the largest in Western Canada, and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest."
"In October 2013, Greater Vancouver had an estimated population of approximately 2.5 million."
"Since 2017, the province has been governed by the New Democratic Party, led by John Horgan, first with a minority government elected in 2017 and subsequently with a majority government elected in 2020."
"The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria, established in 1843, which gave rise to the City of Victoria, at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island."
"The Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866) was subsequently founded on the mainland by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush."
"Moody was chief commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first lieutenant governor of British Columbia: he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire's ""bulwark in the farthest west"", and ""to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific""."
"Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia, New Westminster, and also established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park, and also designed the first version of the coat of arms of British Columbia."
"Port Moody is named after him.In 1866, Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia, and Victoria became the united colony's capital."
"In 1871, British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada."
"Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu (""Splendour without Diminishment"")."
British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871.
"First Nations, the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area."
"Today there are few treaties, and the question of aboriginal title, long ignored, has become a frequently debated legal and political question as a result of recent court actions."
"Notably, the Tsilhqot'in Nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia."
"British Columbia's economy is primarily based on forestry, mining, cinematography and tourism."
British Columbia also benefits from high property values and being a centre for maritime trade.
"Although less than 5 percent of its territory is arable land, a lot of agriculture is done in the Fraser Valley and Okanagan thanks to the warmer climate."
It is the fourth-largest province or territory by GDP.
"Sky burial (Tibetan: བྱ་གཏོར་, Wylie: bya gtor, lit."
"""bird-scattered"") is a funeral practice in which a human corpse is placed on a mountaintop to decompose while exposed to the elements or to be eaten by scavenging animals, especially carrion birds."
It is a specific type of the general practice of excarnation.
"It is practiced in the Chinese provinces and autonomous regions of Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as in Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of India such as Sikkim and Zanskar."
The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the Vajrayana Buddhist traditions as charnel grounds.
Comparable practices are part of Zoroastrian burial practices where deceased are exposed to the elements and birds of prey on stone structures called Dakhma.
"Few such places remain operational today due to religious marginalisation, urbanisation and the decimation of vulture populations.The majority of Tibetan people and many Mongols adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits."
"There is no need to preserve the body, as it is now an empty vessel."
Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose.
The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the origin of the practice's Tibetan name).
"In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional Buddhist practice of cremation."
"In the past, cremation was limited to high lamas and some other dignitaries, but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to an increased use of cremation by commoners.Other nations which performed air burial were the Caucasus nations of Georgians, Abkhazians and Adyghe people, in which they put the corpse in a hollow tree trunk."
"Toast of… is a British television sitcom, known either as Toast of London (when it was set in London) or Toast of Tinseltown (with episodes set in America)."
"It was created by Arthur Mathews and Matt Berry and stars Berry as Steven Toast, an eccentric, middle-aged actor with a chequered past who spends more time dealing with his problems off stage than performing on it."
Prior (or  prioress) is an ecclesiastical title for a  superior in some religious orders.
"The word is derived from the Latin for ""earlier"" or ""first""."
Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior.
"In abbeys, a prior would be lower in rank than the abbey's abbot or abbess."
The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.
It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.
"In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails."
Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
"The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds."
"An alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition."
"It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses."
"Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed."
"At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types."
"Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations."
"China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries."
"The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops."
"Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing."
"Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber."
"Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended."
Whole blood (WB) is human blood from a standard blood donation.
"It is used in the treatment of massive bleeding, in exchange transfusion, and when people donate blood to themselves."
One unit of whole blood (~517 mls) brings up hemoglobin levels by about 10 g/L.
Cross matching is typically done before the blood is given.
"It is given by injection into a vein.Side effects include red blood cell breakdown, high blood potassium, infection, volume overload, lung injury, and allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis."
"Whole blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma."
"It is best within a day of collection; however, can be used for up to three weeks."
"The blood is typically combined with an anticoagulant and preservative during the collection process.The first transfusion of whole blood was in 1818; however, common use did not begin until the First and Second World Wars."
"It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system."
In the 1980s the cost of whole blood was about US$50 per unit in the United States.
Whole blood is not commonly used outside of the developing world and military.
"It is used to make a number of blood products including packed red blood cells, platelet concentrate, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma."
"A whistle is an instrument which produces sound from a stream of gas, most commonly air."
"It may be mouth-operated, or powered by air pressure, steam, or other means."
Whistles vary in size from a small slide whistle or nose flute type to a large multi-piped church organ.
Whistles have been since early humans first carved out a gourd or branch and found they could make sound with it.
"In prehistoric Egypt, small shells were used as whistles."
Many present day wind instruments are inheritors of these early whistles.
"With the rise of more mechanical power, other forms of whistles have been developed."
"One characteristic of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone."
The conversion of flow energy to sound comes from an interaction between a solid material and a fluid stream.
The forces in some whistles are sufficient to set the solid material in motion.
"Classic examples are Aeolian tones that result in galloping power lines, or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (the so-called ""Galloping Gertie"" of popular media)."
"Other examples are circular disks set into vibration.Depending on the geometry, there are two basic types of whistles: those that generate sound through oscillations of fluid mass flow, and those that generate sound through oscillations of the force applied to the surrounding medium."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost."
"The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (""to create, generate, contrive, devise"") and ingenium (""cleverness"")."
"The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations."
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.
"Wormian bones, also known as intrasutural bones or sutural bones, are extra bone pieces that can occur within a suture (joint) in the skull."
"These are irregular isolated bones that can appear in addition to the usual centres of ossification of the skull and, although unusual, are not rare."
"They occur most frequently in the course of the lambdoid suture, which is more tortuous than other sutures."
They are also occasionally seen within the sagittal and coronal sutures.
"A large wormian bone at lambda is often called an Inca bone (Os Incae), due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence in Peruvian mummies."
"Another specific Wormian bone, the pterion ossicle, sometimes exists between the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid bone."
They tend to vary in size and can be found on either side of the skull.
"Usually, not more than several are found in a single individual, but more than one hundred have been once found in the skull of a hydrocephalic adult."
"Wormian bones are a marker for some diseases and important in the primary diagnosis of brittle bone disease: osteogenesis imperfecta.Wormian bones may also be seen in: 

Pycnodysostosis
Osteogenesis imperfecta
Rickets
""Kinky-hair"" Menke's syndrome
Cleidocranial dysostosis
Hypothyroidism and hypophosphatasia
Otopalatodigital syndrome
Primary acro-osteolysis
Down syndrome"
Police Squad!
was an American television crime comedy series broadcast on the ABC network in 1982.
"It was created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, and starred Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin."
"A spoof of police procedurals, the series featured Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker's usual sight gags, wordplay and non sequiturs."
"While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show M Squad (in particular the opening credits) and the late 1960s series Felony Squad."
"Although the show was canceled after six episodes, it was later followed by a successful film trilogy, The Naked Gun, which was produced from 1988 to 1994."
"In 2013, TV Guide ranked it #7 on its list of 60 shows that were ""Cancelled Too Soon""."
"Gorillas are herbivorous,  predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa."
"The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies."
"The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos."
"Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex."
"They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback."
The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences.
Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.
Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa.
"Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations."
"The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft)."
"Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda."
"There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas."
"Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered."
"There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species."
"However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live."
"A prince is a male ruler (ranked below a king, grand prince, and grand duke) or a male member of a monarch's or former monarch's family."
"Prince is also a title of nobility (often highest), often hereditary, in some European states."
The feminine equivalent is a princess.
"The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun prīnceps, from primus (first) and capio (to seize), meaning ""the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble ruler, prince""."
"Captain is a title for the commander of a military unit, the commander of a ship, aeroplane, spacecraft, or other vessel, or the commander of a port, fire department or police department, election precinct, etc."
"The captain is a military rank in armies, navies, Public Health Service, coast guards, etc., typically at the level of an officer commanding a company or battalion of infantry, a ship, or a battery of artillery, or similar distinct unit."
The terms also may be used as an informal or honorary title for persons in similar commanding roles.
"Law is a system of rules created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior, with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate."
It has been variously described as a science and the art of justice.
"State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions."
"Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation."
"The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein."
"The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people."
"Legal systems vary between countries, with their differences analysed in comparative law."
"In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law."
"In common law systems, judges make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature."
"Historically, religious law influenced secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities."
"Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia.Law's scope can be divided into two domains."
"Public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law."
"Private law deals with legal disputes between individuals and/or organisations in areas such as contracts, property, torts/delicts and commercial law."
"This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions.Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology."
"Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice."
"A sundress or summer dress is an informal or casual dress intended to be worn in warm weather, typically in a lightweight fabric, most commonly cotton, and usually loose-fitting."
"It is commonly a bodice style sleeveless dress, typically with a wide neckline and thin shoulder straps, and may be backless."
"A sundress is typically worn without a layering top and is not usually worn over a blouse, sweater, or t-shirt, or with leggings."
"While the word ""sundress"" was first used in the early 1940s, they really came into vogue in the 1950s, and were especially popularized by Lilly Pulitzer in the 1960s."
Naturism is a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social nudity in private and in public; the word also refers to the cultural movement which advocates and defends that lifestyle.
Both may alternatively be called nudism.
"Though the two terms are broadly interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated."
"That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology."
"Ethical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing."
"At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose."
"Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities."
"Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals through officially designated nude beaches and parks and on to public spaces and buildings in some jurisdictions."
"Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement."
"Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law."
Many legal instruments were written under seal by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removed the need for consideration in contract law).
"However, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect."
The brown long-eared bat or common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) is a small Eurasian insectivorous bat.
"It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold."
It is extremely similar to the much rarer grey long-eared bat which was only validated as a distinct species in the 1960s.
"An adult brown long-eared bat has a body length of 4.5–4.8 cm, a tail of 4.1–4.6 cm, and a forearm length of 4–4.2 cm."
"The ears are 3.3–3.9 cm in length, and readily distinguish the long-eared bats from most other bat species."
They are relatively slow flyers compared to other bat species.
"Copy testing is a specialized field of marketing research that determines an advertisement's effectiveness based on consumer responses, feedback, and behavior."
"Also known as pre-testing, it might address all media channels including television, print, radio, outdoor signage, internet, and social media."
Automated Copy Testing is a specialized type of digital marketing specifically related to digital advertising.
This involves using software to deploy copy variations of digital advertisements to a live environment and collecting data from real users.
These automated copy tests will generally use a Z-test to determine the statistical significance of results.
"If a specific ad variation out performs the baseline in the copy test, to a desired level of statistical significance, this new copy variation should be used by the marketer."
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time.
The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future.
"The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection."
"In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language."
"The first known use of the word ""past"" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning ""to pass."""
"A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic energy."
"Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps.Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary), and consume energy to perform mechanical work moving the fluid."
"Pumps operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines, or wind power, and come in many sizes, from microscopic for use in medical applications, to large industrial pumps."
"Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for  water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems."
"In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis."
"When a casing contains only one revolving impeller, it is called a single-stage pump."
"When a casing contains two or more revolving impellers, it is called a double- or multi-stage pump."
"In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps."
"The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of snakehead fish native to China, Russia, North Korea, and South Korea, ranging from the Amur River to Hainan."
"It has been introduced to other regions, where it is considered invasive."
"In Europe, the first report of the species was from Czechoslovakia in 1956."
"In the United States, the fish is considered to be a highly invasive species."
Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten.
"Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season."
"Freezing food slows decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species."
"In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing)."
The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture.
Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure.
Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature −196 °C (−320 °F).Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers.
Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase.
"An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK's Waste & Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food ""as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date""."
"The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change, provided the food had been stored correctly up to that time."
"A gun is a ranged weapon designed to use a shooting tube (gun barrel) to launch typically solid projectiles, but can also project pressurized liquid (e.g."
"water guns/cannons, spray guns for painting or pressure washing, projected water disruptors, and technically also flamethrowers), gas (e.g."
light-gas gun) or even charged particles (e.g.
plasma gun).
"Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon guns)."
A large-caliber gun is also referred to as a cannon.
"The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within the barrel tube, produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns)."
"The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle."
"Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns)."
The first devices identified as guns or proto-guns appeared in China from around CE 1000.
"By the end of the 13th century, they had become ""true guns,"" metal barrel firearms that fired single projectiles which occluded the barrel."
Gunpowder and gun technology spread throughout Eurasia during the 14th century.
"The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant."
The species originated in western South America and Central America.
"The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived."
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
"The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange."
"From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor."
"The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks."
"While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year."
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
"Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals."
"(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.)"
"The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width."
A fern (Polypodiopsida or  Polypodiophyta ) is a member of a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers.
"They differ from mosses and other bryophytes by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase."
"Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls, that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses."
Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns.
They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds.
"The group includes about 10,560 known extant species."
"Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns."
"Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the late Devonian period, but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, after flowering plants came to dominate many environments."
"The fern Osmunda claytoniana is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis; paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years."
"Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants and for remediating contaminated soil."
They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere.
"Some fern species, such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides) are significant weeds worldwide."
"Some fern genera, such as Azolla, can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies."
They also play certain roles in folklore.
"During the Cold War, a number of pilots from various nations (Eastern Bloc, Western Bloc, and non-aligned) defected with their aircraft to other countries."
Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).
"Simply put, it is ""any activity or enterprise entered into for profit."
"""Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business."
"If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions."
A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates.
The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company.
"A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates."
"A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner."
A sentry box is a small shelter with an open front in which a sentry or person on guard duty may stand to be sheltered from the weather.
Many boxes are decorated in national colours.
"A prison, also known as a jail or gaol (dated, standard English, Australian, and historically in Canada), penitentiary (American English and Canadian English), detention center (or detention centre outside the US), correction center, correctional facility,  lock-up or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as punishment for various crimes."
Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
"In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed."
Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes.
"Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice."
"In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps."
"In American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always followed in casual speech."
"A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government."
A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g.
"for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention) and is usually operated by a local government, typically the county sheriff."
"Outside of North America, prison and jail often have the same meaning."
"Dinnertime is the second album by Alex Taylor, brother of James, Livingston and Kate Taylor."
The album was recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio.
"The standout tracks are ""Change Your Sexy Ways"", Randy Newman's ""Lets Burn Down the Cornfield"", Scott Boyer's ""Comin' Back to You"", and Stephen Stills' ""Four Days Gone""."
Time-and-a-half is payment to a worker (or workers) at 1.5 times their usual hourly rate.
It is usually paid as an incentive to work on a particular day (such as Saturday) or as government-mandated compensation for having workers work on particular days (such as public holidays).
"Respect, also called esteem, is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important or held in high esteem or regard."
It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities.
"It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles."
"In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise."
"Courtesies that show respect may include simple words and phrases like ""Thank you"" in the West or ""Namaste"" in the Indian subcontinent, or simple physical signs like a slight bow, a smile, direct eye contact, or a simple handshake; however, those acts may have very different interpretations, depending on the cultural context."
"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context."
"The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment."
Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
"Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money."
"Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity."
"It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ""all debts, public and private""."
Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
"The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts)."
"Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries."
"In chemistry, a hydrate is a substance that contains water or its constituent elements."
"The chemical state of the water varies widely between different classes of hydrates, some of which were so labeled before their chemical structure was understood."
"In botany, a plant shoot  consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds."
The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop.
"In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants."
"In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems."
"Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves."
"Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the  fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest."
"As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure."
Some plants (e.g.
bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.
"The Concord grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca (also known as fox grape) that are used as table grapes, wine grapes and juice grapes."
"They are often used to make grape jelly, grape juice, grape pies, grape-flavored soft drinks, and candy."
"The grape is sometimes used to make wine, particularly sacramental kosher wine."
"Traditionally, most commercially produced Concord wines have been finished sweet, but dry versions are possible if adequate fruit ripeness is achieved."
The grape is named after the town in Massachusetts where it was developed.
"The skin of a Concord grape is typically dark blue or purple, and often is covered with a lighter-coloured epicuticular wax ""bloom"" that can be rubbed off."
"It is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit."
Concord grapes have large seeds and are highly aromatic.
"The Concord grape is particularly prone to the physiological disorder black spot.In the United States 417,800 tons were produced in 2011."
"The major growing areas are the Finger Lakes District of New York, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Southwestern Michigan, and the Yakima Valley in Washington."
They are sometimes found growing wild.
Iron () is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.
"It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core."
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.
"In its metallic state, iron is rare in the Earth's crust, limited mainly to deposition by meteorites."
"Iron ores, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) or higher, about 500 °C (900 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper."
"Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys, in some regions, only around 1200 BCE."
That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.
"In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost."
"The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or per pound (see Metal#uses)."
Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray.
"However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust."
"Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion."
"Although iron readily reacts, high purity iron, called electrolytic iron, has better corrosion resistance."
"The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin."
"These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles."
"To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet."
"Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III)."
"Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium."
"Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +7."
"Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue, have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications."
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
"Self-incrimination is the act of exposing oneself generally, by making a statement, ""to an accusation or charge of crime; to involve oneself or another [person] in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof""."
"(Self-incrimination can occur either directly or indirectly: directly, by means of interrogation where information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed; or indirectly, when information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed voluntarily without pressure from another person).In many legal systems, accused criminals cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves—they may choose to speak to police or other authorities, but they cannot be punished for refusing to do so."
"There are 108 countries and jurisdictions that currently issue legal warnings to suspects, which include the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel."
"These laws are not uniform across the world; however, members of the European Union have developed their laws around the EU's guide."
A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity.
"It may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics."
It is not inherently sovereign.
"The largest country in the world by geographical area is Russia, while the most populous is China."
The smallest and the least populous is the microstate Vatican City.
"An error (from the Latin error, meaning ""wandering"") is an action which is inaccurate or incorrect."
"In some usages, an error is synonymous with a mistake."
"In statistics, ""error"" refers to the difference between the value which has been computed and the correct value."
An error could result in failure or in a deviation from the intended performance or behavior.
"The Yellowstone River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 692 miles (1,114 km) long, in the Western United States."
"Considered the principal tributary of upper Missouri, via its tributaries, it drains an area stretching from the Rocky Mountains in the vicinity of Yellowstone National Park, across the mountains and high plains of southern Montana and northern Wyoming."
"It flows northeast to its confluence with the Missouri River on the North Dakota side of the border, about 25 miles west of present-day Williston."
"In the sport of ten-pin bowling, there are many different ways in which to deliver (known as a ""throw"" or ""roll"") the bowling ball in order to advance it toward the pins in an accurate and powerful manner."
"Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling."
"The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form."
"The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy."
"In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category."
"A well-known variant of ""tweening"" is the power stroker."
"Power stroking is often very similar to cranking and bowlers can often fit in either category, therefore bowlers that use one of these two styles are often simply known as power players."
"A fourth style, known as helicopter, spinning, or UFO, is a style that is used to great effect in Asia."
"Finally, many modern bowlers have changed to a one- or two-handed no-thumb delivery."
Most of the various forms use different wrist and hand positions and rely on different timings and body positions to accommodate the differences in each style of release.
"A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system."
A nerve transmits electrical impulses.
It is the basic unit of the peripheral nervous system.
"A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system."
"Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin."
"Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium."
"The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium."
"Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium."
"Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves."
"In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts."
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.
"The word ""laser"" is an acronym for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation""."
"The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow ()."
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent.
"Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography."
"Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar."
"Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum."
"Alternatively, temporal coherence can be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond."
"Lasers are used in optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic, semiconducting chip manufacturing (photolithography), and free-space optical communication, laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment."
Semiconductor lasers in the blue to near-UV have also been used in place of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to excite fluorescence as a white light source.
This permits a much smaller emitting area due to the much greater radiance of a laser and avoids the droop suffered by LEDs; such devices are already used in some car headlamps.
"FireHouse is an American rock band which formed in Richmond, Virginia before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they were signed to Epic Records in 1989."
"The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with hit singles like, ""Reach for the Sky"", ""Don't Treat Me Bad,"" and ""All She Wrote,"" as well as their signature power ballads, ""I Live My Life for You,"" ""Love of a Lifetime,"" and ""When I Look Into Your Eyes."""
"At the 1992 American Music Awards, FireHouse won the award for ""Favorite New Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist."
"""As the 1990s progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in Southeast Asian countries such as Japan, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore."
They also maintained popularity in South America and Europe.
"FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which has successfully charted in Japan."
"The band has also continued to tour internationally, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands from the same genre."
"FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 7 million albums worldwide since their debut.Originally composed of vocalist/keyboardist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000."
"Richardson was replaced two times before current bassist, Allen McKenzie, was given the position in 2004."
"Captain Fantastic is a 2016 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Matt Ross and starring Viggo Mortensen, Frank Langella, Kathryn Hahn, and Steve Zahn."
The story centers on a family forced by circumstances to reintegrate into society after living in isolation for a decade.
"The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016."
It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.
"It was theatrically released on July 8, 2016 by Bleecker Street."
"It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten independent films of 2016 and Mortensen was nominated for the Golden Globe, the BAFTA Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actor."
"A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges."
"A judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment."
"A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court."
"The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions."
"In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury."
"In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate."
The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.
"The somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch, as well as temperature, body position (proprioception), and pain."
"It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli."
"Somatosensation begins when mechano- and thermosensitive structures in the skin or internal organs sense physical stimuli such as pressure on the skin (see mechanotransduction, nociception)."
"Activation of these structures, or receptors, leads to activation of peripheral sensory neurons that convey signals to the spinal cord as patterns of action potentials."
"Sensory information is then processed locally in the spinal cord to drive reflexes, and is also conveyed to the brain for conscious perception of touch and proprioception."
"Note, somatosensory information from the face and head enters the brain through peripheral sensory neurons in the cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve."
The neural pathways that go to the brain are structured such that information about the location of the physical stimulus is preserved.
"In this way, neighboring neurons in the somatosensory cerebral cortex in the brain represent nearby locations on the skin or in the body, creating a map, also called a homunculus."
"Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed."
It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.
"If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop."
"Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory."
This can be related to the neuron.
The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent.
Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor.
Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor.
The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.
"Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data."
Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory.
"Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane."
Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory.
"Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information."
"An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming phenomenon."
"Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors."
"The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted."
"Pain, for example, has been identified as a physical condition that impairs memory, and has been noted in animal models as well as chronic pain patients."
The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.
"Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus."
"Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory."
"Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory."
"The term kola nut usually refers to the seeds of certain species of plant of the genus Cola, placed formerly in the cocoa family Sterculiaceae and now usually subsumed in the mallow family Malvaceae (as subfamily Sterculioideae)."
These cola species are trees native to the tropical rainforests of Africa.
"Their caffeine-containing seeds are used as flavoring ingredients in beverages applied to various carbonated soft drinks, from which the name cola originates."
Ingestion  is the consumption of a substance by an organism.
"In animals, it normally is accomplished by taking in a substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract, such as through eating or drinking."
In single-celled organisms ingestion takes place by absorbing a substance through the cell membrane.
"Besides nutritional items, substances that may be ingested include medication (where ingestion is termed oral administration), recreational drugs, and substances considered inedible, such as foreign bodies or excrement."
Ingestion is a common route taken by pathogenic organisms and poisons entering the body.
"Ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism, e.g."
"""a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood""."
"Lazio (UK: , US: ; Italian: [ˈlattsjo]; Latin: Latium, [ˈɫat̪i.ʊ̃ˑ]) is one of the 20 administrative regions of Italy."
"Situated in the central peninsular section of the country, it has 5,864,321 inhabitants – making it the second most populated region of Italy (after Lombardy and just ahead of Campania) – and its GDP of more than €197 billion per year means that it has the nation's second largest regional economy."
"The capital of Lazio is Rome, which is also the capital and largest city of Italy."
"Scallop () is a common name that is primarily applied to any one of numerous species of saltwater clams or marine bivalve mollusks in the taxonomic family Pectinidae, the scallops."
"However, the common name ""scallop"" is also sometimes applied to species in other closely related families within the superfamily Pectinoidea, which also includes the thorny oysters."
"Scallops are a cosmopolitan family of bivalves which are found in all of the world's oceans, although never in fresh water."
"They are one of very few groups of bivalves to be primarily ""free-living"", with many species capable of rapidly swimming short distances and even of migrating some distance across the ocean floor."
"A small minority of scallop species live cemented to rocky substrates as adults, while others attach themselves to stationary or rooted objects such as sea grass at some point in their lives by means of a filament they secrete called a byssal thread."
"The majority of species, however, live recumbent on sandy substrates, and when they sense the presence of a predator such as a starfish, they may attempt to escape by swimming swiftly but erratically through the water using jet propulsion created by repeatedly clapping their shells together."
"Scallops have a well-developed nervous system, and unlike most other bivalves all scallops have a ring of numerous simple eyes situated around the edge of their mantles."
"Many species of scallops are highly prized as a food source, and some are farmed as aquaculture."
"The word ""scallop"" is also applied to the meat of these bivalves, the adductor muscle, that is sold as seafood."
"The brightly coloured, symmetric, fan-shaped shells of scallops with their radiating and often fluted ornamentation are valued by shell collectors, and have been used since ancient times as motifs in art, architecture, and design."
"Owing to their widespread distribution, scallop shells are a common sight on beaches and are often brightly coloured, making them a popular object to collect among beachcombers and vacationers."
"The shells also have a significant place in popular culture, including symbolism."
"A theory is a rational type of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking."
The process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as observational study or research.
"Theories may be scientific, belong to a non-scientific discipline, or no discipline at all."
"Depending on the context, a theory's assertions might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works."
"The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings."
"In modern science, the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science."
"Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction (""falsify"") of it."
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word ""theory"" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis)."
"Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions."
"Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values."
": 131  A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models."
To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.
": 46 The word theory or ""in theory"" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before."
"In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis."
"Instead of using the word ""hypothetically"", it is replaced by a phrase: ""in theory""."
"In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it ""just a theory"" (implying that the idea has not even been tested)."
"Hence, that word ""theory"" is very often contrasted to ""practice"" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing, which is opposed to theory."
"A ""classical example"" of the distinction between ""theoretical"" and ""practical"" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy."
"These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked."
Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.
"Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family."
"Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks."
"Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water."
"Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots."
"An army (from Latin arma ""arms, weapons"" via Old French armée, ""armed"" [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land."
"In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or county."
It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component.
"Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army."
"In some countries, such as France and China, the term ""army"", especially in its plural form ""armies"", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces."
"To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army."
"The naval force, although not using the term ""army"", is also included in the broad sense of the term ""armies"" — thus the French Navy is an integral component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the Ministry of the Armies."
"A similar pattern is seen in China, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military, the land force being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA Navy, and other branches."
"By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia."
"Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc."
"Regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel."
"Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act), from de facto ""non-statutory"" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies."
Armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).
"The word joy means the emotion evoked by well-being, success, or good fortune, and is typically associated with feelings of intense, long lasting happiness."
Slade are  a British rock band formed in Wolverhampton in 1966.
"They rose to prominence during the glam rock era in the early 1970s, achieving 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones on the UK Singles Chart."
The British Hit Singles & Albums names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles.
They were the first act to have three singles enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea.
"As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies."
"According to the 1999 BBC documentary It's Slade, the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.Following an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity in the UK waned, but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival."
The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career.
"The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II."
"The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day."
They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.
"A number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Undertones, The Runaways, The Clash, Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Poison, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, The Replacements, Cheap Trick, Oasis, Quiet Riot (who covered Slade songs for two of their three biggest hits) and Britny Fox."
"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense, and the deliberate misspelling of their song titles (such as ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"") for which they became well known."
"An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics."
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s.
"Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom."
They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).
"Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers."
They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost.
"By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools."
"Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices."
"In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets."
"For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations."
Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra.
"Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space."
"As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more."
"In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information."
"By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%."
"A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve."
People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.
"A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value."
"A Fistful of Dollars (Italian: Per un pugno di dollari, lit."
"'For a Fistful of Dollars' titled on-screen as Fistful of Dollars) is a 1964 Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first leading role, alongside John Wells, Marianne Koch, W. Lukschy, S. Rupp, Jose Calvo, Antonio Prieto, and Joe Edger."
"The film, an international co-production between Italy, West Germany, and Spain, was filmed on a low budget (reported to be $200,000), and Eastwood was paid $15,000 for his role.Released in Italy in 1964 and then in the United States in 1967, it initiated the popularity of the Spaghetti Western genre."
"It was followed by For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, also starring Eastwood."
"Collectively, the films are known as the ""Dollars Trilogy"", or the ""Man with No Name Trilogy"" after the United Artists publicity campaign referred to Eastwood's character in all three films as the ""Man with No Name""."
"All three films were later released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom."
"The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, Yojimbo's production company.As few Spaghetti Westerns had yet been released in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names."
"These included Leone himself (""Bob Robertson""), Gian Maria Volonté (""Johnny Wels""), and composer Ennio Morricone (""Dan Savio"")."
"A Fistful of Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both in the province of Almería."
"In medicine, a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat) by trained fingertips."
"The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery)."
Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.
"The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation, traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute."
The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers.
"This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger)  is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep)."
The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.
Police brutality is the excessive and unwarranted use of force by law enforcement.
It is an extreme form of police misconduct or violence and is a civil rights violation.
It also refers to a situation where officers exercise undue or excessive force against a person.
"Police violence includes but is not limited to physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, inaction of police officers, and in some cases, death."
"The wildlife of the Democratic Republic of the Congo includes its flora and fauna, comprising a large biodiversity in rainforests, seasonally flooded forests and grasslands."
Wildlife is threatened by overhunting for bushmeat.
The country is considered one of the 17 megadiverse nations.
"Its rainforests harbour many rare and endemic species, such as the chimpanzee and the bonobo."
"Five of the country's national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites: the Garumba, Kahuzi-Biega, Salonga and Virunga National Parks, and Okapi Wildlife Reserve."
All five sites are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage In Danger.
The civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity.
Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work.
The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.
"In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone."
"Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound."
"There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead."
"Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll."
"Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way."
"Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani."
A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.
"A father figure is usually an older man, normally one with power, authority, or strength, with whom one can identify on a deeply psychological level and who generates emotions generally felt towards one's father."
"Despite the literal term ""father figure"", the role of a father figure is not limited to the biological parent of a person (especially a child), but may be played by uncles, grandfathers, elder brothers, family friends, or others."
The similar term mother figure refers to an older woman.
"Several studies have suggested that positive father figures and mother figures (whether biological or not) are generally associated with healthy child development, both in boys and in girls."
Play therapy refers to a range of methods of capitalising on children's natural urge to explore and harnessing it to meet and respond to the developmental and later also their mental health needs.
"It is also used for forensic or psychological assessment purposes where the individual is too young or too traumatised to give a verbal account of adverse, abusive or potentially criminal circumstances in their life."
Play therapy is extensively acknowledged by specialists as an effective intervention in complementing children's personal and inter-personal development.
Play and play therapy are generally employed with children aged six months through late adolescence and young adulthood.
They provide a contained way for them to express their experiences and feelings through an imaginative self-expressive process in the context of a trusted relationship with the care giver or therapist.
"As children's and young people's experiences and knowledge are typically communicated through play, it is an essential vehicle for personality and social development."
"In recent years play therapists in the western hemisphere, as a body of health professionals, are usually members or affiliates of professional training institutions and tend to be subject to codes of ethical practice."
"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop."
"A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three."
"After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws."
"The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated."
"Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill."
"On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard."
"It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling."
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.
"The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning)."
"Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one."
"Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports."
"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition."
"Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas."
The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.
"Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup."
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships.
"The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women."
"Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits whose main preserving agent is sugar and sometimes acid, often stored in glass jars and used as a condiment or spread."
"There are many varieties of fruit preserves globally, distinguished by method of preparation, type of fruit used, and place in a meal."
"Sweet fruit preserves such as jams, jellies and marmalades are often eaten at breakfast on bread or as an ingredient of a pastry or dessert, whereas more savory and acidic preserves made from ""vegetable fruits"" such as tomato, squash or zucchini, are eaten alongside savoury foods such as cheese, cold meats, and curries."
Expect is an extension to the Tcl scripting language written by Don Libes.
The program automates interactions with programs that expose a text terminal interface.
"Expect, originally written in 1990 for the Unix platform, has since become available for Microsoft Windows and other systems."
"Veins are blood vessels in humans, and most other animals that carry blood towards the heart."
"Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart."
"In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart."
Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin.
There are valves (called pocket valves) in most veins to prevent backflow.
"Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn."
"At or around the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice."
"The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture."
"When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa."
"Liquid oxygen—abbreviated LOx, LOX or Lox in the aerospace, submarine and gas industries—is the liquid form of molecular oxygen."
"It was used as the oxidizer in the first liquid-fueled rocket invented in 1926 by Robert H. Goddard, an application which has continued to the present."
The Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) is a United States Air Force program that determines promotions to the ranks of Staff Sergeant (E-5) through Technical Sergeant (E-6).
"It provides feedback score sheets to enlisted members considered for promotion, which help members to focus on specific professional development needs."
"Selections for promotion to Master Sergeant (E-7), Senior Master Sergeant (E-8), and Chief Master Sergeant (E-9) utilize an integrated weighted and central selection board system."
"In addition to the weighted score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the whole person concept."
"Board scores are determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and education."
The board score is added to the weighted score to determine order of merit for promotion.
Sea cucumbers are echinoderms from the class Holothuroidea ().
"They are marine animals with a leathery skin and an elongated body containing a single, branched gonad."
Sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor worldwide.
"The number of holothurian () species worldwide is about 1,717, with the greatest number being in the Asia-Pacific region."
Many of these are gathered for human consumption and some species are cultivated in aquaculture systems.
"The harvested product is variously referred to as trepang, namako, bêche-de-mer, or balate."
"Sea cucumbers serve a useful role in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients, breaking down detritus and other organic matter, after which bacteria can continue the decomposition process.Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin, calcified structures that are usually reduced to isolated microscopic ossicles (or sclerietes) joined by connective tissue."
"In some species these can sometimes be enlarged to flattened plates, forming an armour."
"In pelagic species such as Pelagothuria natatrix (order Elasipodida, family Pelagothuriidae), the skeleton is absent and there is no calcareous ring.Sea cucumbers are named for their resemblance to the fruit of the cucumber plant."
"Well-being, also known as wellness, prudential value or quality of life, refers to what is intrinsically valuable relative to someone."
"So the well-being of a person is what is ultimately good for this person, what is in the self-interest of this person."
Well-being can refer to both positive and negative well-being.
"In its positive sense, it is sometimes contrasted with ill-being as its opposite."
"The term ""subjective well-being"" denotes how people experience and evaluate their lives, usually measured in relation to self-reported well-being obtained through questionnaires."
"Sometimes different types of well-being are distinguished, like mental well-being, physical well-being, economic wellbeing or emotional well-being."
The different forms of well-being are often closely interlinked.
"For example, improved physical well-being (e.g., by reducing or ceasing an addiction) is associated with improved emotional well-being."
"As another example, better economic well-being (e.g., possessing more wealth) tends to be associated with better emotional well-being even in adverse situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Well-being plays a central role in ethics since what we ought to do depends, at least to some degree, on what would make someone's life go better or worse."
"According to welfarism, there are no other values besides well-being.The terms well-being, pleasure and happiness are used in overlapping ways in everyday language but their meanings tend to come apart in technical contexts like philosophy or psychology."
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good and is usually seen as one constituent of well-being.
"But there may be other factors, such as health, virtue, knowledge or the fulfillment of desires."
"Happiness, often seen either as ""the individual’s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience"" or as the state of being satisfied with one's life as a whole, is also commonly taken to be a constituent of well-being."
Theories of well-being try to determine what is essential to all forms of well-being.
Hedonistic theories equate well-being with the balance of pleasure over pain.
"Desire theories hold that well-being consists in desire-satisfaction: the higher the number of satisfied desires, the higher the well-being."
Objective list theories state that a person's well-being depends on a list of factors that may include both subjective and objective elements.
"Well-being is the central subject of positive psychology, whose goal is to discover the factors that contribute to human well-being."
"Martin Seligman, for example, suggests that these factors consist in having positive emotions, being engaged in an activity, having good relationships with other people, finding meaning in one's life and a sense of accomplishment in the pursuit of one's goals.The Oxford English Dictionary traces the term well-being to a 16th-century calque of the Italian concept benessere."
"In finance and economics, interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate."
It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party.
"It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited."
"In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower."
"Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise."
"(Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.)"
The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage).
Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal.
"Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate."
A hot dog (less commonly spelled hotdog) is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun.
The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself.
"The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, also just called frank)."
The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.
Some consider it to be a sandwich.
Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide.
"Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon, and olives."
Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket.
The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
These types of sausages were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States.
"It became a working-class street food in the U.S., sold at stands and carts."
The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture.
"Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century."
"Its preparation varies regionally in the country, emerging as an important part of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine."
"Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died) or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate."
"Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria."
Biology is the science that studies life.
There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life.
"One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve."
Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids.
"Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds."
"The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity."
"Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of Earth 4.54 billion years ago."
The earliest known life forms are bacteria.
"Life on Earth is probably descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed."
Metal-Binding Proteins that allowed biological electron transfer may have evolved from minerals.
"The classic 1952 Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth."
"Complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions."
"Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth."
The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.
"There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids."
"Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells."
"In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by ""life"" through obsolete concepts such as Odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries."
Aristotle is considered to be the first person to classify organisms.
"Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species."
"Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing significant revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms."
"Though currently only known on Earth, life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of extraterrestrial life."
"Artificial life is a computer simulation or human-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life."
"Death is the permanent termination of all biological processes which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life."
"Extinction is the term describing the dying-out of a group or taxon, usually a species."
Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.
"Another definition is ""any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided""."
"Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest)."
"Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet."
"The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth."
"Acting as a huge  heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle."
Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.
The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean.
The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present.
"The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur."
This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse.
"Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients."
Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere.
This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.
Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark.
"The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less."
Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf.
Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface.
"In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F)."
"Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F)."
Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean.
Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents.
"These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity."
"Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves."
"Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current."
"Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe."
This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.
"Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.
"The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification."
"The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation."
It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to  food and other resources.
"Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species."
"However, the ocean is subject to numerous environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification and other effects of climate change."
The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.
A box (plural: boxes) is a container used for the storage or transportation of its contents.
"Most boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides."
"Boxes can be very small (like a matchbox) or very large (like a shipping box for furniture), and can be used for a variety of purposes from functional to decorative."
"Boxes may be made of a variety of materials, both durable, such as wood and metal; and non-durable, such as corrugated fiberboard and paperboard."
Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as shipping containers.
"Most commonly, boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides, making them rectangular prisms; but boxes may also have other shapes."
"Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps, doors, or a separate lid."
"They can be secured shut with adhesives, tapes, or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms, such as a catch, clasp or lock."
"Red is the colour at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet."
It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
"It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan."
"Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art."
The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories.
"It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces."
": 60–61  In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal."
"The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes."
"Red became a symbolic color of communism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries."
"Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage."
"Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy."
"In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune."

The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor).
"Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue."
"Taste, along with  olfaction and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances."
Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis.
The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.
"The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye."
Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.
The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds.
There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.
"Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat."
Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.
"Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness,  bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami)."
Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.
Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions.
"Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds."
"Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc."
"; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and ""coolness"" (such as of menthol) and ""hotness"" (pungency), through chemesthesis."
"As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies."
"Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.Among humans, taste perception begins to fade at an older age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production."
Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia).
"Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities."
"A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature."
The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control.
"The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks."
"Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants."
"Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a  market garden)."
"Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses."
"The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one."
"Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens."
"Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden, which etymologically implies enclosure, often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden."
"Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all."
"Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether."
Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at many scales and working on both public and private projects.
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument.
"Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator."
"The strike may be made by an internal ""clapper"" or ""uvula"", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell)."
"Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials."
This depends on the function.
"Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal."
"Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower."
"Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters."
"Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services."
"Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom."
The study of bells is called campanology.
"A balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and air."
"For special tasks, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, granular media (e.g."
"sand, flour or rice), or light sources."
"Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, and can come in many different colors."
"Some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder."
"Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation."
"A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications."
"The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various gases."
He invented them for use in the lab.
A conjugal visit is a scheduled period in which an inmate of a prison or jail is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with a visitor.
"The visitor is usually their legal spouse, and the visit's purpose is usually sexual activity."
The generally recognized basis for permitting such visits in modern times is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to ordinary life after release from prison.
They also provide an incentive to inmates to comply with the various day-to-day rules and regulations of the prison.
"Conjugal visits usually take place in designated rooms or a structure provided for that purpose, such as a trailer or a small cabin."
"Supplies such as soap, condoms, lubricant, bed linens, and towels may be provided."
"Rhythm (from Greek ῥυθμός, rhythmos, ""any regular recurring motion, symmetry"" generally means a ""movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions""."
"This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years."
"Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats:

Rhythm may be defined as the way in which one or more unaccented beats are grouped in relation to an accented one."
"... A rhythmic group can be apprehended only when its elements are distinguished from one another, rhythm...always involves an interrelationship between a single, accented (strong) beat and either one or two unaccented (weak) beats."
"In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry."
"In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style."
"Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as ""timed movement through space"" and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry."
"For example, architects often speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the façade."
"In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars."
"Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, Christopher Hasty, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester, and Guerino Mazzola."
"Adam John Walsh (November 14, 1974 – July 27, 1981) was an American boy who was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall in Hollywood, Florida on July 27, 1981."
"His severed head was found two weeks later in a drainage canal alongside Highway 60 / Yeehaw Junction in rural Indian River County, Florida."
"His death garnered national interest and was made into the 1983 television film Adam, seen by 38 million people in its original airing."
"His father, John Walsh, became an advocate for victims of violent crimes and was the host of the television program America's Most Wanted and, later, In Pursuit with John Walsh."
Convicted serial killer Ottis Toole confessed to Adam's murder but was never convicted of the crime because evidence was lost and Toole later recanted his confession.
"Toole died in prison of liver failure on September 15, 1996."
"No new evidence has come to light since then, and police announced on December 16, 2008 that the Walsh case was closed and that they were satisfied that Toole was the killer."
A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
"A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user."
"The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice."
"A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device."
"This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households."
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
"In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone."
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
"The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker."
"Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously."
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
"Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards."
"These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network."
"For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century."
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
"In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost."
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
"Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs."
"War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias."
"It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces."
"Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general."
"Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties."
"While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances."
"Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of  Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc."
"), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven."
A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
"In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork."
"In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand."
"The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania."
"Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries."
"It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food."
"Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven."
"In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias."
"Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit."
True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
"In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage."
"A marching band is a group of instrumental musicians who perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition."
"Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments."
"Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military-style, that includes an associated organization's colors, name or symbol."
"Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags, rifles, and sabres."
"Marching bands are generally categorized by function, size, age, instrumentation, marching style, and type of show they perform."
"In addition to traditional parade performances, many marching bands also perform field shows at sporting events and marching band competitions."
"Increasingly, marching bands perform indoor concerts that implement many songs, traditions, and flair from outside performances."
"In some cases, at higher level competitions, bands will be placed into classes based on school size."
"Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā, ""heart"" and -λογία -logia, ""study"") is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system."
"The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology."
"Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a specialty of internal medicine."
Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology.
"Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons, a specialty of general surgery."
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"In its broad sense, a territory is ""an area of land; a region"", but in its narrower sense it is ""a geographic region, such as a colonial possession, that is dependent on an external government."""
A territory as an administrative division is usually an area that is under the jurisdiction of a sovereign state.
"In most countries, a territory is an organized division of an area that is controlled by a country but is not formally developed into, or incorporated into, a political unit of the country that is of equal status to other political units that may often be referred to by words such as ""provinces"" or ""regions"" or ""states""."
"In international politics, a territory is usually either the total area from which a state may extract power resources or any non-sovereign geographic area which has come under the authority of another government; which has not been granted the powers of self-government normally devolved to secondary territorial divisions; or both."
"A twig or stick is a thin, often short, branch of a tree or bush.The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away."
"The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig."
There are two types of twig: vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs.
"Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past."
"The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, down the length of the twig."
A governing body is a group of people that has the authority to exercise governance over an organization or political entity.
"The most formal is a government, a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a taken geopolitical system (such as a state) by establishing laws."
"Other types of governing include an organization (such as a corporation recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, family, religious denomination, etc."
"), or another, informal group of people."
"In business and outsourcing relationships, governance frameworks are built into relational contracts that foster long-term collaboration and innovation."
"A board of governors is often the governing body of a public institution, while a board of directors typically serves as the governing body of a corporation or other company larger or more complex than a partnership."
Many professional sports have a sports governing body that serves as their regulating authority.
"Governing bodies can vary widely in size, which is ""important not only for acquiring the necessary range of skills to oversee the entity, but also in promoting cohesion, flexibility, and effective participation of the members to achieve their governance objectives""."
"A governing body is only one component of a system of governance, which also requires a written framework under which the body must operate, and governance mechanisms to both carry out directives of the governing body, and to report information back to the governing body."
"A wrinkle, also known as a rhytide, is a fold, ridge or crease in an otherwise smooth surface, such as on skin or fabric."
"Skin wrinkles typically appear as a result of ageing processes such as glycation,  habitual sleeping positions, loss of body mass, sun damage, or temporarily, as the result of prolonged immersion in water."
"Age wrinkling in the skin is promoted by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors."
"In humans, it can also be prevented to some degree by avoiding excessive solar exposure and through diet (in particular through consumption of carotenoids, tocopherols and flavonoids, vitamins (A, C, D and E), essential omega-3-fatty acids, certain proteins and lactobacilli."
A whip is a tool designed to strike humans or other animals to exert control through pain compliance or fear of pain.
"They can also be used without inflicting pain, for audiovisual cues, such as in equestrianism."
"They are generally either a firm stick designed for direct contact, or a flexible line requiring a specialized swing."
"The former is easier and more precise, the latter offers longer reach and greater force."
A hunting whip combines a firm stick (the stock or handle) with a flexible line (the lash or thong).
"Whips such as the ""cat o' nine tails"" and knout are specifically developed for flagellation as a means of inflicting corporal punishment or torture on human targets."
Certain religious practices and BDSM activities involve the self-use of whips or the use of whips between consenting partners.
"Misuse on non-humans may be considered animal cruelty, and misuse on humans may be viewed as assault."
"A hovercraft, also known as an air-cushion vehicle or ACV, is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice, and other surfaces."
"Hovercraft use blowers to produce a large volume of air below the hull, or air cushion, that is slightly above atmospheric pressure."
"The pressure difference between the higher pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift, which causes the hull to float above the running surface."
"For stability reasons, the air is typically blown through slots or holes around the outside of a disk- or oval-shaped platform, giving most hovercraft a characteristic rounded-rectangle shape."
The first practical design for hovercraft was derived from a British invention in the 1950s.
"They are now used throughout the world as specialised transports in disaster relief, coastguard, military and survey applications, as well as for sport or passenger service."
"Very large versions have been used to transport hundreds of people and vehicles across the English Channel, whilst others have military applications used to transport tanks, soldiers and large equipment in hostile environments and terrain."
"Decline in public demand meant that as of 2021, the only public hovercraft service in the world still in operation serves between the Isle of Wight and Southsea in the UK.Although now a generic term for the type of craft, the name Hovercraft itself was a trademark owned by Saunders-Roe (later British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC), then Westland), hence other manufacturers' use of alternative names to describe the vehicles."
The standard plural of hovercraft is hovercraft (in the same manner that aircraft is both singular and plural).
"Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators."
"Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health."
"Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals."
"In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other."
"Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser."
A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
"Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs."
"Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition."
"Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports."
"However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports."
"The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner."
Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.
"It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression."
"Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news."
"Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting."
"Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport."
"According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013."
"The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport."
"A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments."
Meetings can be used as form of group decision making.
"""I Care"" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Tom T. Hall."
"It was released in December 1974 as the only single from the album, Songs of Fox Hollow."
"""I Care"" was Hall's sixth number one on the U.S. country singles chart."
The single had a one-week stay at number one and remained on the chart for a total of ten weeks.
"Toward; (Scottish Gaelic: Tollard) is a village near Dunoon, Scotland, at the southern tip of the Cowal peninsula."
"During the Second World War, the Toward area was a training centre called HMS Brontosaurus also known as the No 2 Combined Training Centre (CTC), based at Castle Toward."
"Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development."
"Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research."
"Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves."
"Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational."
The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
"Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship."
"In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age."
"There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies."
A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.
"Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all."
Candyass is the debut album by American industrial rock band Orgy.
"It was released on August 18, 1998."
"A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs."
"A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each ""hand"" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having ""hands"" instead of paws on their front limbs."
"The raccoon is usually described as having ""hands"" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers."
"It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb."
The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist.
Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.
"Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback."
"They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands."
"Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning."
"Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language."
"Likewise, the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques."
"A sled dog is a dog trained and used to pull a land vehicle in harness, most commonly a sled over snow."
"Sled dogs have been used in the Arctic for at least 8,000 years and, along with watercraft, were the only transportation in Arctic areas until the introduction of semi-trailer trucks, snowmobiles and airplanes in the 20th century, hauling supplies in areas that were inaccessible by other methods."
"They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush."
"Sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
"Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Russia, Canada, and Alaska as well as much of Greenland."
"They are used for recreational purposes and racing events, such as the Iditarod Trail and the Yukon Quest."
"A bareboat charter or demise charter is an arrangement for the chartering or hiring of a ship or boat, whereby no crew or provisions are included as part of the agreement; instead, the people who rent the vessel from the owner are responsible for taking care of such things."
"This act is commonly known as bareboating or bareboat charter.There are legal differences between a bareboat charter and other types of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters."
"In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time."
"In these charters, the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew."
"In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew."
"The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a ""disponent owner""."
The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group."
"Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration."
In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.
"A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning."
"Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as single episodes."
"Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders."
"Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional, usually a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist."
The causes of mental disorders are often unclear.
Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields.
"Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks."
"This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context."
A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health.
"Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers, using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning."
Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals.
Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options.
"Other treatments include lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer support, and self-help."
"In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or treatment."
"Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.In 2019, common mental disorders around the globe include depression, which affects about 264 million, bipolar disorder, which affects about 45 million, dementia, which affects about 50 million, and schizophrenia and other psychoses, which affects about 20 million people."
Neurodevelopmental disorders include intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders which usually arise in infancy or childhood.
"Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion."
Thunder is the sound caused by lightning.
"Depending upon the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a long, low rumble to a sudden, loud crack."
The sudden increase in temperature and hence pressure caused by the lightning produces rapid expansion of the air in the path of a lightning bolt.
"In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, often referred to as a ""thunderclap"" or ""peal of thunder""."
The study of thunder is known as brontology.
"A patrol is commonly a group of personnel, such as law enforcement officers, military personnel, or private security contractors that are assigned to monitor a specific geographic area."
This is also often referred to as a beat.
"Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, typically of nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding."
"The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat."
"The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called ""runs""."
"The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases."
A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.
The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely.
"A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called ""out"" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting."
"The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners ""out"", which forces them out of the field of play."
Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out.
The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs.
One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning.
"A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins."
"If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played."
"Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning."
Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century.
"This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed."
"By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States."
"Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan."
"In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central."
The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series.
The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.
"The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world."
A  battle  is an occurrence of combat in warfare between opposing military units of any number or size.
A war usually consists of multiple battles.
"In general, a battle is a military engagement that is well defined in duration, area, and force commitment."
An engagement with only limited commitment between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish.
"The word ""battle"" can also be used infrequently to refer to an entire operational campaign, although this usage greatly diverges from its conventional or customary meaning."
"Generally, the word ""battle"" is used for such campaigns if referring to a protracted combat encounter in which either one or both of the combatants had the same methods, resources, and strategic objectives throughout  the encounter."
"Some prominent examples of this would be the Battle of the Atlantic, Battle of Britain, and Battle of Stalingrad, all in World War II."
"Wars and military campaigns are guided by military strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility."
"German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that ""the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war"" was the essence of strategy."
Cowardice is a trait wherein excessive fear prevents an individual from taking a risk or facing danger.
It is the opposite of courage.
"As a label, ""cowardice""  indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge."
"One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.The United States military codes of justice proscribe cowardice in combat as a crime punishable by death (note the phrase ""shot at dawn"").As the opposite of an action or trait that many existing and formerly extant cultures demand, cowardice rates as a character flaw that many societies and their representatives stigmatize and/or punish."
"A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover."
"The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices)."
"In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll."
A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
"As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read."
"In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained."
Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book.
"In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts."
"The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book."
"Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls."
"In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook."
"Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album."
Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
"Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper."
"An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm""."
A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore.
Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries.
"Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published."
"In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks."
"A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred."
"The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, ""sleeping place"") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs."
"The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an ""above-ground grave"" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice."
"In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries."
These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs.
"Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled."
"Owe is a surname or given name, a spelling variation of Ove."
"Notable people with the name include: 

Baard Owe (born 1936), Norwegian-born actor
Owe Adamson (born 1935), Swedish cyclist and Olympic competitor
Owe Hellberg (born 1953), Swedish Left Party politician
Owe Jonsson (1940–1962), Swedish sprinter, ice hockey and bandy player
Owe Lostad (1922–2013), Swedish rower and Olympic competitor
Owe Nordqvist (born 1927), Swedish cyclist and Olympic competitor
Owe Ohlsson (born 1938), Swedish footballer and manager
Owe Thörnqvist (born 1929), Swedish troubadour, revue artist and songwriter
Owe Wiktorin (born 1940), Swedish General"
"A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae)."
"The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs."
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination.
"Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant."
Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.
"Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma."
This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
"Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen."
"After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds."
"In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft, religion, medicine, and as a source of food."
"In Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 fictional universes, Chaos refers to the parasitic entities which live in a different plane of reality, known as the Warp or Immaterium in Warhammer 40,000 and as the Realm of Chaos in Warhammer Age of Sigmar."
"The term can refer to these warp entities and their influence, the servants and worshippers of these entities, or even the parallel universe in which these entities are supposed to reside."
"The most powerful of these warp entities are those known as the Chaos Gods, also sometimes referred to as the Dark Gods, Ruinous Powers, or the Powers of Chaos."
"Similarities exist between the Warhammer idea of Chaos and the concept of Chaos from Michael Moorcock's Elric saga, which also influenced D&D's alignment system."
Further similarities can be seen with the godlike extradimensional Great Old Ones of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's stories.
"A bathroom or washroom is a room, typically in a home or other residential building, that contains either a bathtub or a shower (or both)."
The inclusion of a wash basin is common.
In some parts of the world e.g.
"India, a toilet is typically included in the bathroom; in others, the toilet is typically given a dedicated room separate from the one allocated for personal hygiene activities."
"In North American English the word 'bathroom' is sometimes used to refer to any room in a residence that contains a toilet, regardless of the inclusion of a bath or shower."
"Historically, bathing was often a collective activity, which took place in public baths."
"In some countries the shared social aspect of cleansing the body is still important, as for example with sento in Japan and the ""Turkish bath"" (also known by other names) throughout the Islamic world."
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid.
"Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils."
A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio.
The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing.
A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.
"Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils."
"Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics."
"Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines."
Rowing is the act of propelling a boat using the motion of oars in the water by displacing water to propel the boat forward.
Rowing and paddling are similar.
"However, rowing requires oars to have a mechanical connection with the boat, while paddles (used for paddling) are hand-held and have no mechanical connection."
"In some strict terminologies, using oars for propulsion may be termed either ""pulling"" or ""rowing"", with different definitions for each."
"Where these strict terminologies are used, the definitions are reversed depending on the context: on salt water a pulling boat has one person working each oar, whilst rowing means each person operates two oars on either side of the boat."
"On inland waterways, the opposite applies, with rowing being where each person in a crew works one oar."
"Similarly ""sculling"" can mean propelling a boat with a single oar operated over the stern or, especially in sport rowing, each person operating two oars."
": 135 : 226–227 This article focuses on the general types of rowing, such as recreation and transport rather than the sport of competitive rowing which is a specialized case of racing using strictly regulated equipment and a highly refined technique."
"A check mark (American English), checkmark (Philippine English), tickmark (Indian English) or tick (Australian, New Zealand English, and British English) is a mark (✓, ✔, etc.)"
"used, primarily in the English-speaking world, to indicate the concept ""yes"" (e.g."
"""yes; this has been verified"", ""yes; that is the correct answer"", ""yes; this has been completed"", or ""yes; this [item or option] applies to me"")."
"The x mark is also sometimes used for this purpose (most notably on election ballot papers, e.g."
"in the United Kingdom), but otherwise usually indicates ""no"", incorrectness, or failure."
"One of the earliest usages of a check mark as an indication of completion is on ancient Babylonian tablets ""where small indentations were sometimes made with a stylus, usually placed at the left of a worker's name, presumably to indicate whether the listed ration has been issued."
"""As a verb, to check (off) or tick (off), means to add such a mark."
"Printed forms, printed documents, and computer software (see checkbox), commonly include squares in which to place check marks."
Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.
It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary.
Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures.
Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures.
"As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways."
A ballet as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production.
Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers.
"Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and using elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery."
"In linguistics and grammar, affirmation and negation (abbreviated respectively AFF and NEG) are the ways that grammar encodes positive and negative polarity in verb phrases, clauses, or other utterances."
"Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or truth of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity."
"Examples are the sentences ""Jane is here"" and ""Jane is not here""; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative."
The grammatical category associated with affirmative and negative is called polarity.
"This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc."
may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative).
"Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English not, an affix such as Japanese -nai, or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate."
"The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so."
"Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to questions) are often expressed using particles or words such as yes and no, where yes is the affirmative and no the negative particle."
"The Granary Burying Ground in Massachusetts is the city of Boston's third-oldest cemetery, founded in 1660 and located on Tremont Street."
"It is the final resting place for many notable Revolutionary War-era patriots, including Paul Revere, the five victims of the Boston Massacre, and three signers of the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine."
"The cemetery has 2,345 grave-markers, but historians estimate that as many as 5,000 people are buried in it."
"The cemetery is adjacent to Park Street Church, behind the Boston Athenaeum and immediately across from Suffolk University Law School."
It is a site on Boston's Freedom Trail.
"The cemetery's Egyptian revival gate and fence were designed by architect Isaiah Rogers (1800–1869), who designed  an identical gate for Newport's Touro Cemetery."
"A rubber band (also known as an elastic band, gum band or lacky band) is a loop of rubber, usually ring or oval shaped, and commonly used to hold multiple objects together."
"The rubber band was patented in England on March 17, 1845 by Stephen Perry."
"Most rubber bands are manufactured out of natural rubber or, especially at larger sizes, an elastomer, and are sold in a variety of sizes."
"Notable developments in the evolution of rubber bands began in 1923 when William H. Spencer obtained a few Goodyear inner tubes and cut the bands by hand in his basement, where he founded Alliance Rubber Company."
Spencer persuaded the Akron Beacon Journal as well as the Tulsa World to try wrapping their newspapers with one of his rubber bands to prevent them from blowing across lawns.
He went on to pioneer other new markets for rubber bands such as: agricultural and industrial applications and a myriad of other uses.
"Spencer obtained a patent on February 19, 1957 for a new ""Method for Making Elastic Bands"" which produced rubber bands in an Open Ring design."
"A generalized tonic–clonic seizure, commonly known as a grand mal seizure or GTCS, is a type of generalized seizure that produces bilateral, convulsive tonic and clonic muscle contractions."
Tonic–clonic seizures are the seizure type most commonly associated with epilepsy and seizures in general and the most common seizure associated with metabolic imbalances.
"It is a misconception that they are the sole type of seizure, as they are the main seizure type in approximately 10% of those with epilepsy.These seizures typically initiate abruptly with either a focal or generalized onset."
A prodrome (a vague sense of impending seizure) may also be present before the seizure begins.
"The seizure itself includes both tonic and clonic contractions, with tonic contractions usually preceding clonic contractions."
"After these series of contractions, there is an extended postictal state where the person is unresponsive and commonly sleeping with loud snoring."
There is usually pronounced confusion upon awakening.
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.
"Another definition is ""any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided""."
"Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest)."
"Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet."
"The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth."
"Acting as a huge  heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle."
Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.
The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean.
The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present.
"The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur."
This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse.
"Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients."
Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere.
This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.
Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark.
"The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less."
Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf.
Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface.
"In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F)."
"Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F)."
Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean.
Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents.
"These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity."
"Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves."
"Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current."
"Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe."
This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.
"Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.
"The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification."
"The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation."
It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to  food and other resources.
"Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species."
"However, the ocean is subject to numerous environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification and other effects of climate change."
The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.
"A sister is a woman or girl who shares one or more parents with another individual, a sibling."
The male counterpart is a brother.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full sister is a first degree relative.
"In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities, sometimes as described by a wave equation."
"In physical waves, at least two field quantities in the wave medium are involved."
"Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some frequency."
"When the entire waveform moves in one direction it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave."
"In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero."
The types of waves most commonly studied in classical physics are mechanical and electromagnetic.
"In a mechanical wave, stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium."
A mechanical wave is a local deformation (strain) in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too.
"For example, sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium."
"Other examples of mechanical waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations (standing waves), and vortices."
"In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations."
Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent).
"Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays."
"Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity; heat diffusion waves; plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction–diffusion waves, such as in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more."
"Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer energy, momentum, and information, but they do not transfer particles in the medium."
In mathematics and electronics waves are studied as signals.
"On the other hand, some waves have envelopes which do not move at all such as standing waves (which are fundamental to music) and hydraulic jumps."
"Some, like the probability waves of quantum mechanics, may be completely static."
"A physical wave is almost always confined to some finite region of space, called its domain."
"For example, the seismic waves generated by earthquakes are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet, so they can be ignored outside it."
"However, waves with infinite domain, that extend over the whole space, are commonly studied in mathematics, and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains."
A plane wave is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any (infinite) plane normal to a specific direction of travel.
"Mathematically, the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency."
"In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and/or different frequencies."
A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or longitudinal if those vectors are exactly in the propagation direction.
Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids (such as air) can only be longitudinal.
That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave's polarization which can be an important attribute for waves having more than one single possible polarization.
"A chemical plant is an industrial process plant that manufactures (or otherwise processes) chemicals, usually on a large scale."
The general objective of a chemical plant is to create new material wealth via the chemical or biological transformation and or separation of materials.
"Chemical plants use specialized equipment, units, and technology in the manufacturing process."
"Other kinds of plants, such as polymer, pharmaceutical, food, and some beverage production facilities, power plants, oil refineries or other refineries, natural gas processing and biochemical plants, water and wastewater treatment, and pollution control equipment use many technologies that have similarities to chemical plant technology such as fluid systems and chemical reactor systems."
Some would consider an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical or polymer manufacturer to be effectively a chemical plant.
Petrochemical plants (plants using chemicals from petroleum as a raw material or  feedstock) are usually located adjacent to an oil refinery to minimize transportation costs for the feedstocks produced by the refinery.
Speciality chemical and fine chemical plants are usually much smaller and not as sensitive to location.
Tools have been developed for converting a base project cost from one geographic location to another.
"Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes ."
"Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales."
"Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws."
"To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung."
Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
"Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards."
"These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae)."
"Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans."
"Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans."
"More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species."
"They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length."
The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.
"Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago."
"The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)."
The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.
Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans.
Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
"The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems."
"As a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours."
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
"Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol."
"The unit of measurement ""day"" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds."
The second is designated the SI base unit of time.
"Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition."
"A civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time."
"Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis."
"However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next."
"For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word ""daytime"" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear."
"The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, ""On which day?"""
The biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
"A guide book or travel guide is ""a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists""."
"It will usually include information about sights, accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities."
Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included.
"Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet."
Travel guides can also take the form of travel websites.
"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action.
Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention.
The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content.
"Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan."
Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so.
"Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs."
Theories of intention try to capture the characteristic features of intentions.
The belief-desire theory is the traditionally dominant approach.
"According to a simple version of it, having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action."
"Belief-desire theories are frequently criticized based on the fact that neither beliefs nor desires involve a practical commitment to performing an action, which is often illustrated in various counterexamples."
The evaluation theory tries to overcome this problem by explaining intentions in terms of unconditional evaluations.
"That is to say that intentions do not just present the intended course of action as good in some respect, as is the case for desires, but as good all things considered."
"This approach has problems in explaining cases of akrasia, i.e."
that agents do not always intend what they see as the best course of action.
A closely related theory identifies intentions not with unconditional evaluations but with predominant desires.
It states that intending to do something consists in desiring it the most.
Opponents of this approach have articulated various counterexamples with the goal of showing that intentions do not always coincide with the agent's strongest desire.
A different approach to the theories mentioned so far is due to Elizabeth Anscombe and denies the distinction between intentions and actions.
"On her view, to intend a goal is already a form of acting towards this goal and therefore not a distinct mental state."
"This account struggles to explain cases in which intentions and actions seem to come apart, as when the agent is not currently doing anything towards realizing their plan or in the case of failed actions."
"The self-referentiality theory suggests that intentions are self-referential, i.e."
that they do not just represent the intended course of action but also represent themselves as the cause of the action.
But the claim that this happens on the level of the content of the intention has been contested.
"The term ""intention"" refers to a group of related phenomena."
"For this reason, theorists often distinguish various types of intentions in order to avoid misunderstandings."
The most-discussed distinction is that between prospective and immediate intentions.
"Prospective intentions, also known as ""prior intentions"", involve plans for the future."
They can be subdivided according to how far they plan ahead: proximal intentions involve plans for what one wants to do straightaway whereas distal intentions are concerned with a more remote future.
"Immediate intentions, on the other hand, are intentions that guide the agent while they are performing the action in question."
"They are also called  ""intentions-in-action"" or ""act-related"" intentions."
"The term ""intention"" usually refers to anticipated means or ends that motivate the agent."
"But in some cases, it can refer to anticipated side-effects that are neither means nor ends to the agent."
"In this case, the term ""oblique intention"" is sometimes used."
Intentions are rationally evaluable: they are either rational or irrational.
"Conscious intentions are the paradigmatic form of intention: in them, the agent is aware of their goals."
But it has been suggested that actions can also be guided by unconscious intentions of which the agent is not aware.
"The formation of intentions is sometimes preceded by the deliberation of promising alternative courses of action and may happen in decisions, in which the agent chooses between these alternatives."
"Intentions are responsible for initiating, sustaining, and terminating actions and are frequently used to explain why people engage in a certain behavior."
Understanding the behavior of others in terms of intentions already happens in early childhood.
"Important in this context is the role of gestures, pointing, attention, and eye movement to understand the intentions of others and to form shared intentions."
"In the philosophy of action, a central question is whether it is true for all intentional actions that they are caused or accompanied by intentions."
The theory of reasoned action aims to predict behavior based on how pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms determine behavioral intentions.
"In ethics, the intention principle states that whether an action is morally permissible sometimes depends on the agent's intention for performing this action."
"A hairstyle, hairdo, haircut or coiffure refers to the styling of hair, usually on the human scalp."
"Sometimes, this could also mean an editing of facial or body hair."
"The fashioning of hair can be considered an aspect of personal grooming, fashion, and cosmetics, although practical, cultural, and popular considerations also influence some hairstyles.The oldest known depiction of hair styling is hair braiding which dates back about 30,000 years."
"In history, women's hair was often elaborately and carefully dressed in special ways, though it was also often kept covered outside the home, especially for married women."
"From the time of the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, most women grew their hair as long as it would naturally grow."
"Between the late 15th century and the 16th century, a very high hairline on the forehead was considered attractive."
"Around the same time period, European men often wore their hair cropped no longer than shoulder-length."
"In the early 17th century, male hairstyles grew longer, with waves or curls being considered desirable."
The male wig was pioneered by King Louis XIII of France (1601–1643) in 1624.
Mullets or periwigs for men were introduced into the English-speaking world with other French styles in 1660.
"Late 17th century wigs were very long and wavy, but became shorter in the mid-18th century, by which time they were normally white."
Short hair for fashionable men was a product of the Neoclassical movement.
"In the early 19th century the male beard, and also moustaches and sideburns, made a strong reappearance."
"From the 16th to the 19th century, European women's hair became more visible while their hair coverings grew smaller."
In the middle of the 18th century the pouf style developed.
"During the First World War, women around the world started to shift to shorter hairstyles that were easier to manage."
In the early 1950s women's hair was generally curled and worn in a variety of styles and lengths.
"In the 1960s, many women began to wear their hair in short modern cuts such as the pixie cut, while in the 1970s, hair tended to be longer and looser."
In both the 1960s and 1970s many men and women wore their hair very long and straight.
"In the 1980s, women pulled back their hair with scrunchies."
"During the 1980s, punk hairstyles were adopted by many people."
"A cape is a clothing accessory or a sleeveless outer garment which drapes the wearer's back, arms, and chest, and connects at the neck."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
"Thebe Neruda Kgositsile (born February 24, 1994), also known by his stage name Earl Sweatshirt, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer."
"Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker Sly Tendencies when he began rapping in 2008, but soon changed his name when Tyler, the Creator invited him to join his alternative hip hop collective Odd Future in late 2009."
"He gained recognition and critical praise for his debut mixtape, Earl, which he released in March 2010, at the young age of 16."
"Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in Samoa for at-risk teens for a year and a half."
"He was unable to record music during his tenure there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday."
"Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut studio album, Doris, in August 2013.His second album, I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, followed in March 2015, and his third, Some Rap Songs, released in November 2018."
His projects have all received widespread critical praise.
"He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by Columbia Records."
"On November 1, 2019, Kgositsile released an EP titled Feet of Clay."
Eyes are organs of the visual system.
"They provide living organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision."
Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons.
"In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain."
"Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system."
"Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light."
"From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex."
Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.
"They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans."
"Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere."
"Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia."
"Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails."
"While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets."
"With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals."
They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.
"Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers."
"Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days."
"Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance."
"With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies."
"In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market."
"The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries."
"The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing."
"A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory.In the past, hats were an indicator of social status."
"In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment."
"Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."
Some hats have a protective function.
"As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm."
"Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies."
"Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs."
"Some hats have religious functions, such as the mitres worn by Bishops and the turban worn by Sikhs."
"The Revivalists are an American rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2007."
"The eight-piece band consists of Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar, guitar), David Shaw (lead vocals), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), George Gekas (bass guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums and percussion), Michael Girardot (keyboards and trumpet), and Paulet ""PJ"" Howard (drums and percussion)."
"After The Revivalists released their album, Men Amongst Mountains, on July 17, 2015, they were named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of ""10 Bands You Need to Know""."
"In September 2016, their song ""Wish I Knew You"" reached No."
"1 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart, and in May 2017, the song reached No."
1 on the Alternative Songs chart.
"On September 11, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA.A 2018 single, ""All My Friends,"" from their album, Take Good Care, went to No.1 at Adult Alternative radio."
"Ambrosia psilostachya is a species of ragweed known by the common names Cuman ragweed and perennial ragweed, and western ragweed."
"A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan."
"The functions of a ninja included espionage, deception, and surprise attacks."
Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai.
"Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.In the unrest of the Sengoku period, mercenaries and spies for hire became active in Iga Province and the adjacent area around the village of Kōga, and it is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn."
"Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity."
"A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan."
"Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water and control over natural elements."
"As a consequence, their perception in popular culture is based more on such legends and folklore than on the covert actors of the Sengoku period."
"Plate armour is a historical type of personal body armour made from bronze, iron, or steel plates, culminating in the iconic suit of armour entirely encasing the wearer."
"Full plate steel armour developed in Europe during the Late Middle Ages, especially in the context of the Hundred Years' War, from the coat of plates worn over mail suits during the 14th century."
"In Europe, plate armour reached its peak in the late 15th and early 16th centuries."
"The full suit of armour, also referred to as a panoply, is thus a feature of the very end of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period."
"Its popular association with the ""medieval knight” is due to the specialised jousting armour which developed in the 16th century."
Full suits of Gothic plate armour were worn on the battlefields of the Burgundian and Italian Wars.
"The most heavily armoured troops of the period were heavy cavalry, such as the gendarmes and early cuirassiers, but the infantry troops of the Swiss mercenaries and the Landsknechts also took to wearing lighter suits of ""three quarters"" munition armour, leaving the lower legs unprotected.The use of plate armour declined in the 17th century, but it remained common both among the nobility and for the cuirassiers throughout the European wars of religion."
"After 1650, plate armour was mostly reduced to the simple breastplate (cuirass) worn by cuirassiers."
"This was due to the development of the flintlock musket, which could penetrate armour at a considerable distance."
"For infantry, the breastplate gained renewed importance with the development of shrapnel in the late Napoleonic wars."
"The use of steel plates sewn into flak jackets dates to World War II, replaced by more modern materials such as fibre-reinforced plastic since the 1950s."
"In law, a trial is a coming together of parties to a dispute, to present information (in the form of evidence) in a tribunal, a formal setting with the authority to adjudicate claims or disputes."
One form of tribunal is a court.
"The tribunal, which may occur before a judge, jury, or other designated trier of fact, aims to achieve a resolution to their dispute."
"In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it."
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
A sewing machine is a machine used to sew fabric and  materials together with thread.
Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies.
"Since the invention of the first sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry."
Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type at a time.
"In a modern sewing machine, the process of stitching has been automated so that the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles, thimbles and other tools used in hand sewing."
Early sewing machines were powered by either constantly turning a handle or with a foot-operated treadle mechanism.
Electrically-powered machines were later introduced.
"Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
Diplomacy refers to spoken or written speech acts by representatives of states (such as leaders and diplomats) intended to influence events in the international system.Diplomacy is the main instrument of foreign policy and global governance which represents the broader goals and strategies that guide a state's interactions with the rest of the world.
"International treaties, agreements, alliances, and other manifestations of international relations are usually the result of diplomatic negotiations and processes."
Diplomats may also help shape a state by advising government officials.
"Modern diplomatic methods, practices, and principles originated largely from 17th-century European custom."
"Beginning in the early 20th century, diplomacy became professionalized; the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ratified by most of the world's sovereign states, provides a framework for diplomatic procedures, methods, and conduct."
"Most diplomacy is now conducted by accredited officials, such as envoys and ambassadors, through a dedicated foreign affairs office."
"Diplomats operate through diplomatic missions, most commonly consulates and embassies, and rely on a number of support staff; term diplomat is thus sometimes applied broadly to diplomatic and consular personnel and foreign ministry officials."
A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).
"Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments."
"In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a ""dress shirt"", a specific type of collared shirt)."
A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.
Blake is a surname which originated from Old English.
"Its derivation is uncertain; it could come from ""blac"", a nickname for someone who had dark hair or skin, or from ""blaac"", a nickname for someone with pale hair or skin."
"Another theory, presumably in the belief it is a Welsh patronymic in origin, for which there is no evidence, was that it is a corruption of ""Ap Lake"", meaning ""Son of Lake"".Blake was the name of one of the 14 Tribes of Galway in Ireland."
"These Blakes were descendants of Richard Caddell, alias Blake, who was involved in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169."
"As such a long present foreign name, it became known as de Bláca in Irish.The origins of the name Blake are also considered to be Old Norse, first appearing in Yorkshire, England, possibly derived from the word Blaker, referring to a village and a former municipality of Akershus county, Norway (east of Oslo).Blake often refers to the British poet, painter and printmaker William Blake (1757–1827)."
"In economics, cash ( (listen) kash, or  kaysh in AuE) is money in the physical form of currency, such as banknotes and coins."
"In bookkeeping and financial accounting, cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts)."
"Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets."
"A riddle is a statement, question or phrase having a double or veiled meaning, put forth as a puzzle to be solved."
"Riddles are of two types: enigmas, which are problems generally expressed in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking for their solution, and conundra, which are questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer."
"Archer Taylor says that ""we can probably say that riddling is a universal art"" and cites riddles from hundreds of different cultures including Finnish, Hungarian, American Indian, Chinese, Russian, Dutch and Filipino sources amongst many others."
Many riddles and riddle-themes are internationally widespread.
"In the assessment of Elli Köngas Maranda (originally writing about Malaitian riddles, but with an insight that has been taken up more widely), whereas myths serve to encode and establish social norms, ""riddles make a point of playing with conceptual boundaries and crossing them for the intellectual pleasure of showing that things are not quite as stable as they seem"" — though the point of doing so may still ultimately be to ""play with boundaries, but ultimately to affirm them""."

"The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog, originating in Germany."
The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the Spitz family.
"The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed ""American Eskimo Dog."""
"Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different."
"In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer."
"There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard."
"They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz, Indian Spitz, and Samoyeds."
"A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively."
"Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size."
Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.
"In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing."
"Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head."
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"The hippopotamus ( HIP-ə-POT-ə-məs; Hippopotamus amphibius), also called the hippo, common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal and ungulate native to sub-Saharan Africa."
"It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis)."
"The name comes from the ancient Greek for ""river horse"" (ἱπποπόταμος)."
"After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and is the heaviest extant artiodactyl (in the traditional, non-cladistic sense of the term, excluding cetaceans)."
"Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc."
"), from which they diverged about 55 million years ago."
"Hippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for males and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for females."
"Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances."
"Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos."
"During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and birth both occur in water."
They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses.
"While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land."
The hippo is among the most dangerous animals in the world due to its highly aggressive and unpredictable nature.
They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.
"Log rolling, is a sport involving two competitors, each on one end of a free-floating log in a body of water."
"The athletes battle to stay on the log by sprinting, kicking the log, and using a variety of techniques as they attempt to cause the opponent to fall off."
A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.
The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.
Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.
"Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS."
"Today, many users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions."
"However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line."
"Alternatives to the command line interface include text-based user interface menus (for example, IBM AIX SMIT), keyboard shortcuts, and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer (usually controlled with a mouse)."
"Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, DOS Shell, and Mouse Systems PowerPanel."
Command-line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text-based user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.
Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.
Many software systems implement command-line interfaces for control and operation.
This includes programming environments and utility programs.
"In music, harmony is the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing."
"Usually, this means simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords.Harmony is a perceptual property of music, and, along with melody, one of the building blocks of Western music."
"Its perception is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times throughout Western music."
"In a physiological approach, consonance is a continuous variable."
"Consonant pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough.The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them.Harmony is often said to refer to the ""vertical"" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the ""horizontal"" aspect.Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are therefore sometimes distinguished from harmony.In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities."
"In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with ""tensions""."
A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.
"Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) ""resolves"" to a consonant chord."
Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds.
"In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between ""tense"" and ""relaxed"" moments."
"Comparison or comparing is the act of evaluating two or more things by determining the relevant, comparable characteristics of each thing, and then determining which characteristics of each are similar to the other, which are different, and to what degree."
"Where characteristics are different, the differences may then be evaluated to determine which thing is best suited for a particular purpose."
The description of similarities and differences found between the two things is also called a comparison.
"Comparison can take many distinct forms, varying by field:

To compare is to bring two or more things together (physically or in contemplation) and to examine them systematically, identifying similarities and differences among them."
Comparison has a different meaning within each framework of study.
Any exploration of the similarities or differences of two or more units is a comparison.
"In the most limited sense, it consists of comparing two units isolated from each other."
"To compare things, they must have characteristics that are similar enough in relevant ways to merit comparison."
"If two things are too different to compare in a useful way, an attempt to compare them is colloquially referred to in English as ""comparing apples and oranges."""
"Comparison is widely used in society, in science and in the arts."
"A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes."
"Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive."
"Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping."
"The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables."
"Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times."
"The word ""map"" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world."
"Thus, ""map"" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world."
"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context."
"The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment."
Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
"Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money."
"Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity."
"It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ""all debts, public and private""."
Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
"The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts)."
"Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries."
"A cup is an open-top container used to hold or cold liquids for pouring or drinking; while mainly used for drinking, it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains, salt)."
"Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments."
"Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations."
Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g.
"teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g."
"at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals),or for decoration."
"Mantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 460 genera in 33 families."
"The largest family is the Mantidae (""mantids"")."
Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats.
They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks.
"Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis."
"The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera."
"Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae)."
"Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey."
They normally live for about a year.
"In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die."
The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring.
"Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation."
"Mantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria."
A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale.
Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.
Blacklist (Thai: Blacklist – นักเรียนลับ บัญชีดำ; Blacklist – Nakrian Lap Banchi Dam; lit.
"Secret Student Blacklist) is a 2019 Thai television series starring Korapat Kirdpan (Nanon), Wachirawit Ruangwiwat (Chimon), Pawat Chittsawangdee (Ohm), Sattabut Laedeke (Drake), Kanaphan Puitrakul (First), Thanatsaran Samthonglai (Frank) and Preeti Barameeanant (Bank)."
"Directed by Worrawech Danuwong and produced by GMMTV together with Lasercat Studio, the series was one of the thirteen television series for 2019 launched by GMMTV in their ""Wonder Th13teen"" event on 5 November 2018."
"It premiered on GMM 25 and LINE TV on 13 October 2019, airing on Sundays at 21:25 ICT and 23:00 ICT, respectively."
The series concluded on 29 December 2019.
"A throne is the seat of state of a potentate or dignitary, especially the seat occupied by a sovereign on state occasions; or the seat occupied by a pope or bishop on ceremonial occasions."
"""Throne"" in an abstract sense can also refer to the monarchy or the Crown itself, an instance of metonymy, and is also used in many expressions such as ""the power behind the throne""."
"The expression ""ascend (mount) the throne"" takes its meaning from the steps leading up to the dais or platform, on which the throne is placed, being formerly comprised in the word's significance.When used in a political or governmental sense, throne typically refers to a civilization, nation, tribe, or other politically designated group that is organized or governed under an authoritarian system."
"Throughout much of human history societies have been governed under authoritarian systems, in particular dictatorial or autocratic systems, resulting in a wide variety of thrones that have been used by given heads of state."
"These have ranged from stools in places such as in Africa to ornate chairs and bench-like designs in Europe and Asia, respectively."
"Often, but not always, a throne is tied to a philosophical or religious ideology held by the nation or people in question, which serves a dual role in unifying the people under the reigning monarch and connecting the monarch upon the throne to his or her predecessors, who sat upon the throne previously."
"Accordingly, many thrones are typically held to have been constructed or fabricated out of rare or hard to find materials that may be valuable or important to the land in question."
"Depending on the size of the throne in question it may be large and ornately designed as an emplaced instrument of a nation's power, or it may be a symbolic chair with little or no precious materials incorporated into the design."
"When used in a religious sense, throne can refer to one of two distinct uses."
"The first use derives from the practice in churches of having a bishop or higher-ranking religious official (archbishop, Pope, etc.)"
"sit on a special chair which in church referred to by written sources as a ""throne"", or “Cathedra” (Latin for chair) and is intended to allow such high-ranking religious officials a place to sit in their place of worship."
The other use for throne refers to a belief among many of the world's monotheistic and polytheistic religions that the deity or deities that they worship are seated on a throne.
"Such beliefs go back to ancient times, and can be seen in surviving artwork and texts which discuss the idea of ancient gods (such as the Twelve Olympians) seated on thrones."
"In the major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Throne of God is attested to in religious scriptures and teachings, although the origin, nature, and idea of the Throne of God in these religions differs according to the given religious ideology practiced."
"In the west, a throne is most identified as the seat upon which a person holding the title King, Queen, Emperor, or Empress sits in a nation using a monarchy political system, although there are a few exceptions, notably with regards to religious officials such as the Pope and bishops of various sects of the Christian faith."
"Changing geo-political tides have resulted in the collapse of several dictatorial and autocratic governments, which in turn have left a number of throne chairs empty."
Many of these thrones - such as China's Dragon Throne - survive today as historic examples of nation's previous government.
A calendar is a system of organizing days.
"This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years."
"A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system."
A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.
"A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills."
"Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon."
"The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar, a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain synchronized with the solar year over the long term."
"A finger is a limb of the body and a type of digit, an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of most of the Tetrapods, so also with humans and other primates."
Most land vertebrates have five fingers (Pentadactyly).
A boy is a young male human.
The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent.
"When a male human reaches adulthood, he is described as a man."
"In a deck of playing cards, the term face card (US) or court card (British and US), and sometimes Royalty, is generally used to describe a card that depicts a person as opposed to the pip cards."
"They are also known as picture cards, or until the early 20th century, coat cards."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"General knowledge is information that has been accumulated over time through various mediums, sources."
It excludes specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium.
General knowledge is an essential component of crystallized intelligence.
It is strongly associated with general intelligence and with openness to experience.Studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many.
General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term semantic memory ability.
General knowledge also supports schemata for textual understanding.
"In 2019, it was found in a survey that New Zealanders had ""concerning"" gaps in their general knowledge."
"In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight."
"Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point."
"This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: ""The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width."
"""This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function."
"In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve."
"In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves."
"This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below)."
"Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations."
"Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn."
This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves.
"For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve."
A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates.
"More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one."
"If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves."
"When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface."
"Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied."
"In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography."
"The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit."
"The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness."
"It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates."
"Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others."
"The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714."
"Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry."
"Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries."
"Each apparent ""seed"" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.In 2019, world production of strawberries was 9 million tonnes, led by China with 40% of the total."
"Chief constable is the rank used by the chief police officer of every territorial police force in the United Kingdom except for the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police, as well as the chief officers of the three 'special' national police forces, the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary."
"The title is also held by the chief officers of the principal Crown Dependency police forces, the Isle of Man Constabulary, States of Guernsey Police Service, and States of Jersey Police."
"The title was also held, ex officio, by the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers under the Police Reform Act 2002."
It was also the title of the chief officer of the Royal Parks Constabulary until this agency was disbanded in 2004.
Throughout the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies there are currently fifty chief constables.
"These consist of the chief officers of 37 English territorial forces outside London, four Welsh territorial forces, the Police Service of Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, three special national forces and three Crown Dependency constabularies."
The chief officers of some police departments in Canada also hold the title of chief constable.
The chief officer of the Sovereign Base Areas Police also holds the title of chief constable.
"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool."
"Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements."
"However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)."
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well."
"They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals."
"The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship."
"On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play."
"Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player."
A toy and a game are not the same.
Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction."
"Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both."
"Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role."
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures."
"The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games."
"Punishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority—in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable."
"It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is.The reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law—and respect for rule of law—under which the social group is governed."
"Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion."
"The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable."
"The individual may be a person, or even an animal."
"The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family."
Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here.
"The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called ""correctional process""."
Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.
"Justifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation."
"The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than ""punishment"" may be considered more accurate."
"Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered revenge or spite rather than punishment."
"In addition, the word ""punishment"" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences ""punishment"" during a fight."
"In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment."
"Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty."
Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.
Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.
"Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards."
"Clothing (also known as clothes, apparel, and attire) are items worn on the body."
"Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together."
The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies.
"The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations."
"Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head."
"Eyewear and jewelry are not generally considered items of clothing, but play an important role in fashion and clothing as costume."
"Other wearables are not always considered to be clothing despite belonging to an accepted class, such as orthodontic headgear, which is a medical appliance."
"The human body is not always complete, and sometimes includes prosthetic devices, such as a limb prosthesis, which might be adorned similarly to an intact body, differently, or not at all."
Some styles of prosthetic legs are designed to require ordinary street shoes to function properly.
"Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment."
"Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body."
It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments.
Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.
"It  may used to prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats."
"Clothing is used for protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare."
"Fashioned with pockets, belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands."
Clothing has significant social factors as well.
Wearing clothes is a variable social norm.
It may connote modesty.
Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing.
"In many parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breasts, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure."
"Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs."
"Clothing also may be used to communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism."
"Some forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor's white coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect)."
"More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified protective accessories."
"At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form fitting body covers, and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to amount to more of a tool than a garment."
This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption and flexible electronic substrates.
"Clothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants, other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market — where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise)."
"A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble."
"A rifle is a long-barrelled firearm designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall."
"In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting."
"Rifles are used extensively in warfare, self defense, law enforcement, crime (most notably assassinations), hunting, and shooting sports."
"The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools."
"By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun rifle is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger (e.g., personnel halting and stimulation response rifle, which is actually a laser dazzler)."
"Like all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other propulsive means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (plinking)."
"The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns (e.g., arquebuses, muskets) is the rifling within its gun barrel."
"The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called lands, which make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin around its longitudinal axis."
"When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, preventing yawing and tumbling in flight."
This allows the use of more elongated and aerodynamically efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in smoothbore muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy.
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"A sister is a woman or girl who shares one or more parents with another individual, a sibling."
The male counterpart is a brother.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full sister is a first degree relative.
A stream is a body of water with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel.
"The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs – surface water, subsurface water and groundwater."
The surface and subsurface water are highly variable between periods of rainfall.
"Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation."
"The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls.Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to by a variety of local or regional names."
Long large streams are usually called rivers.
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration."
The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity."
The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is a core element of environmental geography.
"Glitter is an assortment of small, reflective particles that come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors."
"Glitter particles reflect light at different angles, causing the surface to sparkle or shimmer."
"Glitter is similar to confetti, sparkles and sequins, but somewhat smaller."
"Since prehistoric times, glitter has been made from many different materials including stones such as malachite, and mica, as well as insects and glass."
Modern glitter is usually manufactured from the combination of aluminum and plastic which is rarely recycled leading some scientists to call for bans on plastic glitter.
"Laundry refers to the washing of clothing and other textiles, and, more broadly, their drying and ironing as well."
"Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship."
"Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen)."
"The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer."
"Laundry, like cooking and child care, is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.The word ""laundry"" may refer to the clothing itself, or to the place where the cleaning happens."
An individual home may have a laundry room; a utility room includes but is not restricted to the function of washing clothes.
An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a shared laundry facility such as a tvättstuga.
A stand-alone business is referred to as a self-service laundry (launderette in British English or laundromat in North American English).
"A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock."
"A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land."
"A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years."
"Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers."
High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude.
These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals.
"Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing."
"The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level."
"The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft)."
"Radar (radio detection and ranging) is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle, or velocity of objects."
"It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain."
"A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s)."
"Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed."
Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II.
"A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution."
"The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for ""radio detection and ranging""."
"The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization."
"During RAF RADAR courses in 1954/5 at Yatesbury Training Camp ""radio azimuth direction and ranging"" was suggested."
"The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, antimissile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations."
"High tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing, machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels."
Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
"One example is LIDAR, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves."
"With the emergence of driverless vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents."
The following is a list of Scottish clans with and without chiefs.
The crest badges used by members of Scottish clans are based upon armorial bearings recorded by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland.
"The blazon of the heraldic crest is given, and the heraldic motto with its translation into English."
"While all the crest badges of the clan names listed are recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, only about one half of these (about 140) have a clan chief who is acknowledged by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as the rightful claimant of the undifferenced arms upon which the crest badges are based."
Scottish crest badges are heraldic badges used by members of Scottish clans to show their allegiance to a specific clan or clan chief.
"Even though they are commonly used by clan members, the heraldic crest and motto within the crest badge belong only to the clan chief – never the clan member."
"A Scottish clan member's crest badge is made up of a heraldic crest, encircled by a strap and buckle which contains a heraldic motto."
"In most cases, both crest and motto are derived from the crest and motto of the chief's coat of arms."
Crest badges intended for wear as cap badges are commonly made of silver or some other metal such as pewter.
"In the case of armigers they wear their own crest within a plain circlet showing their own motto or slogan, not a belt and buckle showing the chief's."
Women may wear a crest badge as a brooch to pin a sash of their clan tartan at the right shoulder of their gown or blouse.
"Female clan chiefs, chieftains, or the wives of clan chiefs normally wear a tartan sash pinned at their left shoulder."
"Today, Scottish crest badges are commonly used by members of Scottish clans."
"However, much like clan tartans, Scottish crest badges do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, and the dress of the Highland Regiments."
Scottish crest badges have only been worn by clan members on the bonnet since the 19th century.
Anacondas or water boas are a group of large snakes of the genus Eunectes.
They are found in tropical South America.
Four species are currently recognized.
"A tooth (plural teeth) is a hard, calcified structure found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food."
"Some animals, particularly carnivores and omnivores, also use teeth to help with capturing or wounding prey, tearing food, for defensive purposes, to intimidate other animals often including their own, or to carry prey or their young."
The roots of teeth are covered by gums.
"Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness that originate from the embryonic germ layer, the ectoderm."
"The general structure of teeth is similar across the vertebrates, although there is considerable variation in their form and position."
"The teeth of mammals have deep roots, and this pattern is also found in some fish, and in crocodilians."
"In most teleost fish, however, the teeth are attached to the outer surface of the bone, while in lizards they are attached to the inner surface of the jaw by one side."
"In cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, the teeth are attached by tough ligaments to the hoops of cartilage that form the jaw.Some animals develop only one set of teeth (monophyodonts) while others are diphyodonts, i.e."
"they have an early set of deciduous teeth and a later set of permanent or ""adult"" teeth."
Still others develop many sets (polyphyodonts).
"Sharks, for example, grow a new set of teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth."
"Most extant mammals including humans are diphyodonts, but there are exceptions including elephants, kangaroos, and manatees, all of which are polyphyodonts."
"Rodent incisors grow and wear away continually through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length."
The industry of the beaver is due in part to this qualification.
"Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as leporidae like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors."
"Also, tusks (in tusked mammals) grow almost throughout life.Teeth are not always attached to the jaw, as they are in mammals."
"In many reptiles and fish, teeth are attached to the palate or to the floor of the mouth, forming additional rows inside those on the jaws proper."
Some teleosts even have teeth in the pharynx.
"While not true teeth in the usual sense, the dermal denticles of sharks are almost identical in structure and are likely to have the same evolutionary origin."
"Indeed, teeth appear to have first evolved in sharks, and are not found in the more primitive jawless fish – while lampreys do have tooth-like structures on the tongue, these are in fact, composed of keratin, not of dentine or enamel, and bear no relationship to true teeth."
"Though ""modern"" teeth-like structures with dentine and enamel have been found in late conodonts, they are now supposed to have evolved independently of later vertebrates' teeth.Living amphibians typically have small teeth, or none at all, since they commonly feed only on soft foods."
"In reptiles, teeth are generally simple and conical in shape, although there is some variation between species, most notably the venom-injecting fangs of snakes."
"The pattern of incisors, canines, premolars and molars is found only in mammals, and to varying extents, in their evolutionary ancestors."
The numbers of these types of teeth vary greatly between species; zoologists use a standardised dental formula to describe the precise pattern in any given group.
"An organization, or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is an entity—such as a company, an institution, or an association—comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose."
"The word is derived from the Greek word organon, which means tool or instrument, musical instrument, and organ."
Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
"Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria)."
"By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for ""green plants""), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae."
Most plants are multicellular organisms.
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.
"Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color."
"Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds."
"Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common."
"There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds."
"Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems."
"Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia."
"Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs."
"The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology."
"In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference."
"Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs, particularly in their conjugation patterns."
"The main tenses found in many languages include the past, present, and future."
"Some languages have only two distinct tenses, such as past and nonpast, or future and nonfuture."
"There are also tenseless languages, like most of the Chinese languages, though they can possess a future and nonfuture system typical of Sino-Tibetan languages."
In recent work Maria Bittner and Judith Tonhauser have described the different ways in which tenseless languages nonetheless mark time.
"On the other hand, some languages make finer tense distinctions, such as remote vs recent past, or near vs remote future."
Tenses generally express time relative to the moment of speaking.
"In some contexts, however, their meaning may be relativized to a point in the past or future which is established in the discourse (the moment being spoken about)."
This is called relative (as opposed to absolute) tense.
"Some languages have different verb forms or constructions which manifest relative tense, such as pluperfect (""past-in-the-past"") and ""future-in-the-past""."
Expressions of tense are often closely connected with expressions of the category of aspect; sometimes what are traditionally called tenses (in languages such as Latin) may in modern analysis be regarded as combinations of tense with aspect.
"Verbs are also often conjugated for mood, and since in many cases the three categories are not manifested separately, some languages may be described in terms of a combined tense–aspect–mood (TAM) system."
"A shore or a shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake."
"In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, representing the intertidal zone where there is one."
"In contrast to a coast, a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an ocean or a sea."
"Therefore, in that sense, a coast is a type of shore."
"However, the word ""coast"" often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior."
"Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, such as waves."
The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created.
Claytonia perfoliata (syn.
"Montia perfoliata), also known as miner's lettuce, Indian lettuce, spring beauty, winter purslane, or palsingat, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae."
"It is a fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America, from southernmost Alaska and central British Columbia, all the way south to Central America, but most common in California in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin Valleys."
"Together with Claytonia parviflora and C. rubra, C. perfoliata comprises what is almost certainly a polyploid pillar complex, which is based on three diploid species."
Two key studies on the population ecology and genetics of the C. perfoliata complex were published in 2012.
The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of a typical tetrapod.
"It manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste."
The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae.
It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels.
The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth.
A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.
"The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back."
"The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus, on the tongue's surface."
There are two groups of muscles of the tongue.
The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone.
The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone.
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
"Lasagne (US: , also UK: , Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]; singular lasagna, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]) are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets."
"Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil."
"The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking."
Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.
The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.
A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment.
"A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design."
"Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances."
"The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing)."
"The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry."
The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.
"Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments."
These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen.
"For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine."
"In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws."
"They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"Quantum Leap is an American science-fiction television series, created by Donald P. Bellisario, that originally aired on NBC for five seasons, from March 25, 1989 through May 5, 1993."
"It stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who involuntarily leaps through spacetime during experiments in time travel, by temporarily taking the place of other people to correct what he consistently discovers were historical mistakes."
"Dean Stockwell co-stars as Admiral Al Calavicci, Sam's womanizing, cigar-smoking companion and best friend, who appears to him as a hologram and researches and shapes his opinions of the past."
"The series features a mix of humor, drama, romance, social commentary, and science fiction."
"It was ranked number 19 on TV Guide's ""Top Cult Shows Ever"" in 2007."
"Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of  Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc."
"), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven."
A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
"In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork."
"In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand."
"The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania."
"Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries."
"It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food."
"Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven."
"In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias."
"Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit."
True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
"In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage."
"Sombre is a 1998 French film directed by Philippe Grandrieux, starring Marc Barbé and Elina Löwensohn."
The film was nominated for the Golden Leopard and won the C.I.C.A.E.
Award - Special Mention at the Locarno International Film Festival.
"Tissue paper or simply tissue is a lightweight paper or, light crêpe paper."
Tissue can be made from recycled paper pulp.
"Cornbread is a quick bread made with cornmeal, associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States, with origins in Native American cuisine."
It is an example of batter bread.
Dumplings and pancakes made with finely ground cornmeal were staple foods of the Hopi people in Arizona.
The Hidatsa people of the Upper Midwest called baked cornbread naktsi.
"Cherokee and Seneca tribes enriched the basic batter, adding chestnuts, sunflower seeds, apples or berries, and sometimes combining beans or potatoes with the cornmeal."
Modern versions of cornbread are usually leavened by baking powder.
"A yoke is a wooden beam normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load when working in pairs, as oxen usually do; some yokes are fitted to individual animals."
"There are several types of yoke, used in different cultures, and for different types of oxen."
"A pair of oxen may be called a yoke of oxen, and yoke is also a verb, as in ""to yoke a pair of oxen""."
"Other animals that may be yoked include horses, mules, donkeys, and water buffalo."
ToeJam & Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) console.
"Released in 1991, it centers on ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth."
"As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft."
It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.
"ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue (1980) and derived various features from the game, such as the random generation of levels and items."
"As such, ToeJam & Earl is often considered to be an example of a roguelike game.The game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode."
"It attained sleeper hit status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega."
"ToeJam & Earl was followed by two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, released for the Sega Genesis and Xbox respectively."
The sequels' commercial and critical success were mixed.
"A fourth title without Sega's involvement, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, was released on March 1, 2019 with funds from Kickstarter."
The game was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in December 2006 and re-released again on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in November 2012 as part of the Sega Vintage Collection.
"This game was also released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on December 16, 2021."
A passenger (also abbreviated as pax) is a person who travels in a vehicle but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle.
"The vehicles may be bicycles, buses, passenger trains, airliners, ships, ferryboats, and other methods of transportation."
"Crew members (if any), as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle, are usually not considered to be passengers."
"For example, a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a passenger while on duty and the same with those working in the kitchen or restaurant on board a ship as well as cleaning staff, but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger, even if the car was being driven on company business."
"Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera (), in the superorder Endopterygota."
"Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects."
"The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 described species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently, with estimates suggesting that there are between 0.9 to 2.1 million total species."
"Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions, they interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates."
"Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops."
"Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra."
"The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving."
"Beetles are endopterygotes, which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage."
"Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males."
"Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects."
"Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage."
"Beetles are prominent in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling."
Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays.
"Over 300 species are used as food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae."
"However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests."
"Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle."
"Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests."
"Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere."
"There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface."
"Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types."
The boiling point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.
Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes and viruses that may be present.
"The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies, but if water is held at 100 °C (212 °F) for one minute, most micro-organisms and viruses are inactivated."
Ten minutes at a temperature of 70 °C (158 °F) is also sufficient for most bacteria.
"Boiling water is also used in several cooking methods including boiling, steaming, and poaching."
Opera  is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers.
"Such a ""work"" (the literal translation of the Italian word ""opera"") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet."
"The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor."
"Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another.Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition."
"Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theatre, Singspiel and Opéra comique."
"In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias."
The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama.
"Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi, notably L'Orfeo, and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century."
"In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel."
"Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his ""reform"" operas in the 1760s."
"The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), and The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), landmarks in the German tradition."
"The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style."
It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber's introduction of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic Opera).
"The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany."
The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century.
"During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia."
"The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams)."
"With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans."
"Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media."
"Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world."
"Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed."
"A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity."
"A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it."
"The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see The Crown)."
A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules.
"Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of ""his"" federal government."
"SEAT S.A. (English: , Spanish: [ˈseat]; Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo) is a Spanish car manufacturer, which sells its vehicles under the SEAT and Cupra brands."
"It was founded on 9 May 1950, by the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), a Spanish state-owned industrial holding company."
It quickly became the largest supplier of cars in Spain.
"In 1986, after 36 years being publicly listed as an independent automaker, the Spanish government sold SEAT to the Volkswagen Group of which it remains a wholly owned subsidiary.The headquarters of SEAT S.A. are located at the company's industrial complex in Martorell near Barcelona."
"In 2020, annual production was over 468,000 units, with more than 427,000 cars sold in just one year, exported to over 75 countries worldwide."
"A sink – also known by other names including sinker, washbowl, hand basin, wash basin, and simply basin – is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture used for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes."
Sinks have taps (faucets) that supply hot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster rinsing.
They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device.
Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser.
"Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter."
"When a sink becomes clogged, a person will often resort to using a chemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the clog with a drain auger (often called a ""plumber's snake"")."
A committee or commission is a body of one or more persons subordinate to an assembly.
A committee is not itself considered to be a form of assembly.
"Usually, the assembly sends matters into a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the assembly itself were considering them."
Committees may have different functions and their types of work differ depending on the type of the organization and its needs.
"A member of a legislature may be delegated a committee assignment, which gives them the right to serve on a certain committee."
"Credit (from Latin credit, ""(he/she/it) believes"") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date."
"In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people."
The resources provided may be financial (e.g.
"granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g."
consumer credit).
Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment.
"Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower."
Competition is a rivalry where two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game).
"Competition can arise between entities such as organisms, individuals, economic and social groups, etc."
"The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition: (e.g."
"awards, goods, mates, status, prestige), leadership, market share, niches and scarce resources, or a territory."
"Competition occurs in nature, between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment."
"Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources."
"Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment."
"Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers."
Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.
"Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm."
"In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued ""the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system."
"The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players""."
Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory.
"Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology."
"Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition."
They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances.
"They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are."
"Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole."
"Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures."
"They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time."
A plantlet is a young or small plant.Many plants such as spider plants naturally create stolons with plantlets on the ends as a form of asexual reproduction.
Vegetative propagules or clippings of mature plants may form plantlets.
An example is mother of thousands.
Many plants reproduce by throwing out long shoots or runners that can grow into new plants.
"Mother of thousands appears to have lost the ability to reproduce sexually and make seeds, but transferred at least part of the embryo-making process to the leaves to make plantlets."
"In mathematics, sine and cosine are trigonometric functions of an angle."
"The sine and cosine of an acute angle are defined in the context of a right triangle: for the specified angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse), and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse."
"For an angle 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  , the sine and cosine functions are denoted simply as 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin \theta }
   and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos \theta }
  .More generally, the definitions of sine and cosine can be extended to any real value in terms of the lengths of certain line segments in a unit circle."
"More modern definitions express the sine and cosine as infinite series, or as the solutions of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to complex numbers."
"The sine and cosine functions are commonly used to model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year."
"The functions sine and cosine can be traced to the functions jyā and koṭi-jyā, used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta period (Aryabhatiya and Surya Siddhanta), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic, and then from Arabic to Latin."
"The word sine (Latin sinus) comes from a Latin mistranslation by Robert of Chester of the Arabic jiba, itself a transliteration of the Sanskrit word for half of a chord, jya-ardha."
The word cosine derives from a contraction of the medieval Latin complementi sinus.
"A dental drill or handpiece is a hand-held, mechanical instrument used to perform a variety of common dental procedures, including removing decay, polishing fillings, performing cosmetic dentistry, and altering prostheses."
"The handpiece itself consists of internal mechanical components which initiate a rotational force and provide power to the cutting instrument, usually a dental burr."
The type of apparatus used clinically will vary depending on the required function dictated by the dental procedure.
"It is common for a light source and cooling water-spray system to also be incorporated into certain handpieces; this improves visibility, accuracy and overall success of the procedure."
The burrs are usually made of tungsten carbide or diamond.
"A hairball is a small collection of hair or fur formed in the stomach of animals, and uncommonly in humans, that is occasionally vomited up when it becomes too big."
"Hairballs are primarily a tight elongated cylinder of packed fur, but may include bits of other elements such as swallowed food."
"Animals with hairballs are sometimes mistaken as having other conditions of the stomach such as lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and tumor of the spleen."
"Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur, and thereby ingest it."
"Rabbits are also prone to hairballs because they groom themselves in the same fashion as cats, but hairballs are especially dangerous for rabbits because they cannot regurgitate them."
"Due to the digestive systems of rabbits being very fragile, hairballs in rabbits must be treated immediately or they may cause the animal to stop feeding and ultimately die due to dehydration."
"Cattle are also known to accumulate hairballs but, as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can be quite large."
Space Shuttle Columbia (OV-102) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured by Rockwell International and operated by NASA.
"Named after the first American ship to circumnavigate the upper North American Pacific coast and the female personification of the United States, Columbia was the first of five Space Shuttle orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden flight in April 1981."
"As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines."
"In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms (7,900 pounds) heavier than Endeavour."
"Columbia also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an external scientific instrument bay on its vertical stabilizer."
"During its 22 years of operation, Columbia was flown on 28 missions in the Space Shuttle program, spending over 300 days in space and completing over 4,000 orbits around Earth."
"While it was seldom used after completing its objective of testing the Space Shuttle system, and its heavier mass and internal airlock made it unideal for planned Shuttle-Centaur launches and dockings with space stations, it nonetheless proved useful as a workhorse for scientific research in orbit following the loss of Challenger in 1986."
"Columbia was used for eleven of the fifteen flights of Spacelab laboratories, all four United States Microgravity Payload missions, and the only flight of Spacehab's Research Double Module."
"The Extended Duration Orbiter pallet was used by the orbiter in thirteen of the pallet's fourteen flights, which aided lengthy stays in orbit for scientific and technological research missions."
"Columbia was also used to retrieve the Long Duration Exposure Facility and deploy the Chandra observatory, and also carried into space the first female commander of an American spaceflight mission, the first ESA astronaut, the first female astronaut of Indian origin, and the first Israeli astronaut."
"At the end of its final flight in February 2003, Columbia disintegrated upon reentry, killing the seven-member crew of STS-107 and destroying most of the scientific payloads aboard."
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board convened shortly afterwards concluded that damage sustained to the orbiter's left wing during the launch of STS-107 fatally compromised the vehicle's thermal protection system.
The loss of Columbia and its crew led to a refocusing of NASA's human exploration programs and led to the establishment of the Constellation program in 2005 and the eventual retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.
"Numerous memorials and dedications were made to honor the crew following the disaster; the Columbia Memorial Space Center was opened as a national memorial for the accident, and the Columbia Hills in Mars' Gusev crater, which the Spirit rover explored, were named after the crew."
"The majority of Columbia's recovered remains are stored at the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, though some pieces are on public display at the nearby Visitor Complex."
"Adhesive, also known as glue, cement, mucilage, or paste, is any non-metallic substance applied to one or both surfaces of two separate items that  binds them together and resists their separation.The use of adhesives offers certain advantages over other binding techniques such as sewing, mechanical fastenings, or welding."
"These include the ability to bind different materials together, the more efficient distribution of stress across a joint, the cost-effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, and greater flexibility in design."
"Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing."
"Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion followed by reactive or non-reactive, a term which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden."
"Alternatively, they can be organized either by their starting physical phase or whether their raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin."
Adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically.
"The earliest human use of adhesive-like substances was approximately 200,000 years ago, when Neanderthals produced tar from the dry distillation of birch bark for use in binding stone tools to wooden handles."
The first references to adhesives in literature appeared in approximately 2000 BC.
The Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives.
"In Europe, glue was not widely used until the period AD 1500–1700."
From then until the 1900s increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual.
"Only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly, and innovation in the field continues to the present."
"Minutes, also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM), protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing."
"They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues."
A carriage is a private four-wheeled vehicle for people and is most commonly horse-drawn.
"Second-hand private carriages were common public transport, the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis."
"Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping and, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs."
Two-wheeled carriages are informal and usually owner-driven.
Coaches are a special category within carriages.
They are carriages with four corner posts and a fixed roof.
"Two-wheeled war chariots and transport vehicles such as four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were forerunners of carriages.In the twenty-first century, horse-drawn carriages are occasionally used for public parades by royalty and for traditional formal ceremonies."
Simplified modern versions are made for tourist transport in warm countries and for those cities where tourists expect open horse-drawn carriages to be provided.
Simple metal sporting versions are still made for the sport known as competitive driving.
Insects (from Latin insectum) are pancrustacean hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta.
They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum.
"Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae."
Insects are the most diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms.
The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million; potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects.
"Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans, which recent research has indicated insects are nested within."
Nearly all insects hatch from eggs.
Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts.
"The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo  four-stage metamorphosis."
Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages.
The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear.
"Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in)."
The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.
"Adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming."
"As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front and rear on one side with the middle on the other side."
"Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor."
"Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming."
"Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water."
"Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies."
"Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young."
Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways.
Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances.
"Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males."
Lampyrid beetles communicate with light.
"Humans regard certain insects as pests, and attempt to control them using insecticides, and a host of other techniques."
"Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood."
"Some species are parasitic, and may vector diseases."
"Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases."
"Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated."
Many insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.
Silkworms produce silk and honey bees produce honey and both have been domesticated by humans.
"Insects are consumed as food in 80% of the world's nations, by people in roughly 3000 ethnic groups."
Human activities also have effects on insect biodiversity.
Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars.
Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable.
"In addition to sugars like sucrose, many other chemical compounds are sweet, including aldehydes, ketones, and sugar alcohols."
"Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric sugar substitutes."
Such non-sugar sweeteners include saccharin and aspartame.
"Other compounds, such as miraculin, may alter perception of sweetness itself."
"The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.The chemosensory basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century."
"One theoretical model of sweetness is the multipoint attachment theory, which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance."
"Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as chemotaxis even in motile bacteria such as E. coli."
"Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than lactose, the sugar found in breast milk."
"Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution."
"By comparison, bitterness appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution."
"In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density, while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity."
The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting (and energy-dense) foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods.
"Even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves."
"The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged."
Knight-service was a form of feudal land tenure under which a knight held a fief or estate of land termed a knight's fee (fee being synonymous with fief) from an overlord conditional on him as tenant performing military service for his overlord.
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
"An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange); it primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange."
The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata).
"The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo."
"The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar, and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC."
"As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world."
Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit.
"The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel."
"As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production.In 2019, 79 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, followed by China and India."
A parent  is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species.
"In humans, a parent is the caretaker of a child (where ""child"" refers to offspring, not necessarily age)."
"A biological parent is a person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum."
Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet.
A female can also become a parent through surrogacy.
"Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child."
Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.
"It is not legal for parents to sell their kids, for profit or not, and be able to trade them against their will."
A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation.
"With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents."
"Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material.The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents."
"A mother is, ""a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth."""
"The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect, while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive."
"In the fields of sociology and political science, authority is the legitimate power of a person or group over other people."
"In a civil state, authority is practiced in ways such a judicial branch or an executive branch of government.In the exercise of governance, the terms authority and power are inaccurate synonyms."
"The term authority identifies the political legitimacy, which grants and justifies the ruler’s right to exercise the power of government; and the term power identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal, either by compliance or by obedience; hence, authority is the power to make decisions and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution."
A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train.
"If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually rather referred to as a multiple unit, motor coach, railcar or power car; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter and Iron Highway)."
"Traditionally, locomotives pulled trains from the front."
"However, push-pull operation has become common, where the train may have a locomotive (or locomotives) at the front, at the rear, or at each end."
Most recently railroads have begun adopting DPU or distributed power.
The front may have one or two locomotives followed by a mid train locomotive that is controlled remotely from the lead unit.
"A time limit or deadline is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished."
"Once that time has passed, the item may be considered overdue (e.g., for work projects or school assignments)."
"In the case of work assignments or projects that are not completed by the deadline, this may adversely affect the employee's performance rating."
"In the case of school assignments, essays or reports submitted after the deadline, marks or grades may be deducted from the student's assessment."
"In some cases, no materials can be submitted after the deadline."
"This may occur with calls for proposal, commercial tenders for bids, and application dates for universities and professional schools."
"For tests and examinations in schools, universities and job competitions, once the time limit for the test is up, the test-takers must put down their pens or pencils and hand in their test."
"In project management, deadlines are most often associated with milestones."
"Time-based performance targets per se do not affect an individual sense of empowerment as much as the task uncertainty, which arises with frequent changes to such a target."
"The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere."
"The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation)."
"By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases."
"Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere."
"Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude."
"Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere.Earth's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen."
"The atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering."
"Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone depletion and acid deposition."
"The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface."
"The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space."
"The Kármán line, at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space."
Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi).
"Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition."
"The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics."
Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.
The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function.
"As indicated by the disorder's name, the primary symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions."
"Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that generate feelings of anxiety, disgust, or discomfort."
"Common obsessions include fear of contamination, obsession with symmetry, and intrusive thoughts about religion, sex, and harm."
Compulsions are repeated actions or routines that occur in response to obsessions.
"Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, cleaning, arranging things, counting, seeking reassurance, and checking things."
"Many adults with OCD are aware that their compulsions do not make sense, but they perform them anyway to relieve the distress caused by obsessions."
"Compulsions occur so often, typically taking up at least one hour per day, that they impair one's quality of life.The cause of OCD is unknown."
"There appear to be some genetic components, and it is more likely for both identical twins to be affected than both fraternal twins."
Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing events; some cases have occurred after streptococcal infections.
Diagnosis is based on presented symptoms and requires ruling out other drug-related or medical causes; rating scales such as the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) assess severity.
"Other disorders with similar symptoms include generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder."
"The condition is also associated with a general increase in suicidality.Treatment for OCD may involve psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy such as antidepressants, or surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS)."
"CBT increases exposure to obsessions and prevents compulsions, while metacognitive therapy encourages ritual behaviors to alter the relationship to one's thoughts about them."
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a common antidepressant used to treat OCD.
"SSRIs are more effective when used in excess of the recommended depression dosage; however, higher doses can increase side-effect intensity."
"Commonly used SSRIs include sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram."
Some patients fail to improve after taking the maximum tolerated dose of multiple SSRIs for at least two months; these cases qualify as treatment-resistant and require second-line treatment such as clomipramine or atypical antipsychotic augmentation.
"Surgery may be used as a final resort in the most severe or treatment-resistant cases, though most procedures are considered experimental due to the limited literature on their side effects."
"Without treatment, OCD often lasts decades.Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their lives, while rates during any given year are about 1.2%."
"It is unusual for symptoms to begin after age 35, and around 50% of patients experience detrimental effects to daily life before age 20."
"Males and females are affected equally, and OCD occurs worldwide."
"The phrase obsessive–compulsive is sometimes used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone as excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated."
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.
"The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness."
"A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care."
"Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories."
Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
"Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received."
A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students  and auxiliary healthcare students.
A health science  facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic.
Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g.
surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology.
Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units.
"Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology."
"Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations."
"Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers."
"However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals."
"In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original ""places of hospitality"", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers."
The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso.
"In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants."
Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues.
"At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates."
Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy.
"Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape."
"At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals."
"During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding."
"Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics."
"Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography."
They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness.
A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent.
"Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone."
"A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury."
Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.
A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
"For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders."
"In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person."
"In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories."
"Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life."
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes.
"There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases."
"Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases."
"The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections."
"In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety."
"The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause."
A shrub (often called a bush) is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant.
"Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground."
Shrubs can be deciduous or evergreen.
"They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6–10 m (20–33 ft) tall."
"Small shrubs, less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall are sometimes termed subshrubs."
"Many botanical groups have species that are shrubs, and others that are trees and herbaceous plants."
Some definitions state that a shrub is less than 6 m (20 ft) and tree is over 6 m. Others use 10 m (33 ft) as the cut-off point.
"Many species of tree may not reach this mature height because of less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble a shrub-sized plant."
However such species have the potential to grow taller under the ideal growing conditions for that plant.
"In terms of longevity, most shrubs fit in between perennials and trees; some may only last about five years even in good conditions, others, usually the larger and more woody, may live to 70 or more."
"Shrubland is natural landscape dominated by various shrubs; there are many distinct types around the world, including fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland."
"In gardens and parks, an area largely dedicated to shrubs (now somewhat less fashionable than a century ago) is called a shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden."
"There are many garden cultivars of shrubs, bred for flowering, for example rhododendrons, and sometimes leaf colour or shape."
"Compared to trees and herbaceous plants, perhaps a relatively small number of shrubs have agricultural or commercial uses."
"Apart from several berry-bearing species (using the culinary rather than botanical definition), few are eaten directly, and they are generally too small for timber use."
"Those that are used include several perfumed species such as lavender and rose, and a wide range of plants with medicinal uses."
"Tea and coffee are on the tree-shrub boundary; they are normally harvested from shrub-sized plants, but these would become small trees if left to grow."
"An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches."
An egg results from fertilization of an egg cell.
"Most arthropods, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not."
"Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible."
Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows.
"When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell."
"Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering."
The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm × 14 cm × 9 cm (11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in) in size.
Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother.
"At 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) and up to 17.8 cm × 14 cm (7.0 in × 5.5 in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird, though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs."
"The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz)."
"Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller."
"Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed ""spores,"" or in spermatophytes ""seeds,"" or in gametophytes ""egg cells""."
Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons built to launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms.
"Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines."
"As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use."
This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.
"Originally, the word ""artillery"" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor."
"Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, ""artillery"" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, mortars, and rocket artillery."
"In common speech, the word ""artillery"" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called ""equipment""."
"However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses ""artillery piece"", but most English-speaking armies use ""gun"" and ""mortar""."
"The projectiles fired are typically either ""shot"" (if solid) or ""shell"" (if not solid)."
"Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used."
"""Shell"" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions."
"By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines."
"In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility."
"In the 20th century, technology-based target acquisition devices (such as radar) and systems (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged in order to acquire targets, primarily for artillery."
These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms.
"The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm."
Artillery has been used since at least the early Industrial Revolution.
"The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery."
"In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was ""the God of War""."
"Rasheed Abdul Wallace (born September 17, 1974) is an American men's basketball coach for the Memphis Tigers, and former professional basketball player."
"A native of Philadelphia, Wallace played college basketball at the University of North Carolina before declaring for the draft in 1995, where he'd play 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
"Originally selected by the Washington Bullets (now known as the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the 1995 NBA draft, Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his first season."
He was then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after the season.
"With Portland he was a key member of the Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals in 1999 and 2000, and was an NBA All-Star in 2000 and 2001."
Wallace averaged a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Trail Blazers.
During the 2003–04 season Portland traded him to the Atlanta Hawks where he played one game before he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.
"With the Pistons, Wallace won the NBA championship in 2004, and reached the NBA Finals in the following season before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games."
"Individually, Wallace was an NBA All-Star in 2006 and 2008."
"After the 2008–09 season, Wallace left the Pistons as a free agent and signed with the Boston Celtics, where he played until retiring in 2010."
He returned to sign a one-year deal to play for the New York Knicks in 2012.
"On April 17, 2013, Wallace announced his second retirement."
Wallace holds the single-season record for technical fouls.
"In the 2000–01 season, Wallace received 41 technical fouls over a span of 80 games, about one technical foul for every two games."
"A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water."
"The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers."
"The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand."
Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well.
"Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India."
"Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age."
"Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world."
"These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds."
A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole.
"Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water."
"Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole."
Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic.
Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
"Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath."
A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material.
"The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor."
Water may be pumped or hand drawn.
Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided.
Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable.
Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out.
Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.
Afrocarpus falcatus (syn.
Podocarpus falcatus) is a species of tree in the family Podocarpaceae.
"It is native to the montane forests of southern Africa, where it is distributed in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, and Eswatini."
"Common names include common yellowwood, bastard yellowwood, outeniqua yellowwood, African pine tree, weeping yew, Afrikaans: outeniekwageelhout, kalander, Sotho: mogôbagôba, Xhosa: umkhoba and Zulu: umsonti."
"It is widespread, in some areas abundant, and not considered threatened, but it is a protected tree in South Africa."
"It is grown as an ornamental tree, especially in South Africa, and occasionally abroad."
Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity.
Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.
"It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation."
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
"If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands."
"In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains."
"On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass."
"The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes."
"The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities."
"Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics."
Antarctica is the driest continent.
"The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in)."
Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
Rainfall is measured using rain gauges.
Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.
"Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water."
"A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath."
"It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross."
"There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations."
"Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it."
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones.
The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
"The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use."
Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.
"It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology."
It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
"For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics)."
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
"There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g."
"hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc."
"Urban planning, also known as regional planning, town planning, city planning, or rural planning, is a technical and political process that is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks and their accessibility."
"Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements."
"The primary concern was the public welfare, which included considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities."
"Over time, urban planning has adopted a focus on the social and environmental bottom-lines that focus on planning as a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards."
Sustainable development was added as one of the main goals of all planning endeavors in the late 20th century when the detrimental economic and the environmental impacts of the previous models of planning had become apparent.
"Similarly, in the early 21st century, Jane Jacob's writings on legal and political perspectives to emphasize the interests of residents, businesses and communities effectively influenced urban planners to take into broader consideration of resident experiences and needs while planning."
"Urban planning answers questions about how people will live, work and play in a given area and thus, guides orderly development in urban, suburban and rural areas."
"Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities, urban planners are also responsible for planning the efficient transportation of goods, resources, people and waste; the distribution of basic necessities such as water and electricity; a sense of inclusion and opportunity for people of all kinds, culture and needs; economic growth or business development; improving health and conserving areas of natural environmental significance that actively contributes to reduction in CO2 emissions as well as protecting heritage structures and built environments."
"Urban planning is a dynamic field since the questions around how people live, work and play changes with time."
"These changes are constantly reflected in planning methodologies, zonal codes and policies making it a highly technical, political, social, economical and environmental field."
"Urban planning is an interdisciplinary field that includes civil engineering, architecture, human geography, politics, social science and design sciences."
"Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking, Engineering architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management."
"It is closely related to the field of urban design and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas."
"Urban planners work with the cognate fields of civil engineering, landscape architecture, architecture, and public administration to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals."
"Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields though today, urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline."
"The discipline of urban planning is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as land-use planning, zoning, economic development, environmental planning, and transportation planning."
Creating the plans requires a thorough understanding of penal codes and zonal codes of planning.
"Another important aspect of urban planning is that the range of urban planning projects include the large-scale master planning of empty sites or Greenfield projects as well as small-scale interventions and refurbishments of existing structures, buildings and public spaces."
"Pierre Charles L'Enfant in Washington DC, Daniel Burnham in Chicago and Georges-Eugene Haussmann in Paris planned cities from scratch, and Robert Moses and Le Corbusier refurbished and transformed cities and neighbourhoods to meet their ideas of urban planning."
Pippin or Pepin is a masculine given name of Frankish origin with uncertain meaning.
"The name was borne by various members of the Carolingian family that ruled the Austrasian Empire in the Middle Ages, in what is now France and the western parts of Germany."
"Most notable, Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks and father of Charlemagne."
"Other variations of the name are Peppin, Pipin, Pippin (German), Pépin (French), Pepijn (Dutch), Pepino (Italian) or Pepe (Spanish)."
"Musical chairs, also known as Trip to Jerusalem, is a game of elimination involving players, chairs, and music."
It is a staple of many parties worldwide.
"Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in the form of a natural crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite."
Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater.
"The open ocean has about 35 g (1.2 oz) of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%."
"Salt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes."
"Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation."
"Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period."
"Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians."
"Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans."
The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues.
Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.
"Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools."
"Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products."
"Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, about 6% is used for human consumption."
"Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use."
Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency.
"As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods."
Sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute.
"Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults."
Such health effects of salt have long been studied.
"Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods."
"The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day."
"In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (that is, eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence."
They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function).
"For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively."
"In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant."
"Limit inferior is also called infimum limit, limit infimum, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit."
"The limit inferior of a sequence

"A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit)."
"Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus."
"The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in ""ornamental cherry"" or ""cherry blossom""."
"Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name ""wild cherry"" in the British Isles."
"A title is one or more words used before or after a person's name, in certain contexts."
"It may signify either generation, an official position, or a professional or academic qualification."
"In some languages, titles may be inserted between the first and last name (for example, Graf in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage (Richard Cardinal Cushing) or clerical titles such as Archbishop)."
Some titles are hereditary.
The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.
The name is a contraction of binary digit.
The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values.
"These values are most commonly represented as either ""1"" or ""0"", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off are commonly used."
"The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program."
It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.
"The symbol for the binary digit is either 'bit' per recommendation by the IEC 80000-13:2008 standard, or the lowercase character 'b', as recommended by the IEEE 1541-2002 standard."
"A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a single-dimensional (or multi-dimensional) bit array."
"A group of eight binary digits is called one byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined."
"Frequently, half, full, double and quadruple words consist of a number of bytes which is a low power of two."
"In information theory, one bit is the information entropy of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known."
"As a unit of information, the bit is also known as a shannon, named after Claude E. Shannon."
"Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers."
The word also refers to the materials used to upholster something.
"Upholstery comes from the Middle English word upholder, which referred to an artisan who makes fabric furnishings."
"The term is equally applicable to domestic, automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design."
A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer.
An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer.
"Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up."
"In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on."
Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism that traces its origin to the Church of Scotland.
Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government by representative assemblies of elders.
"Many Reformed churches are organised this way, but the word Presbyterian, when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland or to English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War."
"Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ."
"Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain."
"In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America, mostly by Scots and Scotch-Irish immigrants."
"The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism."
"Local congregations of churches which use Presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly)."
"There are roughly 75 million Presbyterians in the world.The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century, the example of John Calvin's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential."
Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government.
"In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches."
"Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches."
"Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists."
"Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scottish immigrants, Scots-Irish immigrants, and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon Plan of Union of 1801 for frontier areas."
"An industrial park (also known as industrial estate, trading estate) is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development."
"An industrial park can be thought of as a more ""heavyweight"" version of a business park or office park, which has offices and light industry, rather than heavy industry."
"Industrial parks are often notable for being relatively economic to build and speedily erected single-space steel sheds, occasionally in bright colours."
"A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.)"
is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans.
"Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers, although the average bus usually carries between 30 to 100."
"The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads for double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads for midibuses and minibuses, while coaches are used for longer-distance services."
"Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare."
"Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, do not charge a fare."
"In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence."
"Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles."
"Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882."
"The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895."
"Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel."
"As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world."
"History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning ""inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation"") is the study and the documentation of the past."
Events before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
"""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events."
"Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect."
"Historians  often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
"Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends."
History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
"However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the ""father of history"" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the ""father of lies""."
"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies."
"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
"The saddle is a supportive structure for a rider of an animal, fastened to an animal's back by a girth."
The most common type is the equestrian saddle designed for a horse.
"However, specialized saddles have been created for oxen, camels and other animals."
"It is not known precisely when riders first began to use some sort of padding or protection, but a blanket attached by some form of surcingle or girth was probably the first ""saddle"", followed later by more elaborate padded designs."
"The solid saddle tree was a later invention, and though early stirrup designs predated the invention of the solid tree, the paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today."
"Today, modern saddles come in a wide variety of styles, each designed for a specific equestrianism discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse."
"Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades."
"The saddle was a crucial step in the increased use of domesticated animals, during the Classical Era."
"An egg case or egg capsule, often colloquially called a mermaid's purse, is the casing that surrounds the eggs of oviparous sharks, skates and chimaeras."
"Egg cases typically contain one embryo, except for big skate and mottled skate egg cases, which contain up to 7 embryos."
Oviparity is completely absent in the superorder Squalomorphii.
Solanum pseudocapsicum is a nightshade species with mildly poisonous fruit.
"It is commonly known as the Jerusalem cherry, Madeira winter cherry, or, ambiguously, ""winter cherry""."
"These perennials can be grown decoratively as house plants, but in some areas of South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand it is regarded as a weed."
"The Sirenia (), commonly referred to as sea-cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters."
"The Sirenia currently comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees, namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species."
The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct.
"Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya)."
"The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene (30–35 mya).Sirenians grow to between 2.5 and 4 metres (8.2 and 13.1 feet) in length and 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds) in weight."
"The historic Steller's sea cow was the largest known sirenian to have lived, and could reach lengths of 10 metres (33 feet) and weights of 5 to 10 tonnes (5.5 to 11.0 short tons).Sirenians have a large, fusiform body to reduce drag through the water."
They have heavy bones that act as ballast to counteract the buoyancy of their blubber.
"They have a thin layer of blubber and consequently are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which cause migrations when water temperatures dip too low."
"Sirenians are slow-moving, typically coasting at 8 kilometres per hour (5.0 miles per hour), but they can reach 24 kilometres per hour (15 miles per hour) in short bursts."
"They use their strong lips to pull out seagrasses, consuming 10–15% of their body weight per day."
"While breathing, they hold just their nostrils above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so."
"Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers."
"They are mainly herbivorous, but have been known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish."
"Males typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating."
"Sirenians are K-selected, and display parental care."
"The meat, oil, bones, and skins are valuable items sold in markets."
"Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and watercraft collisions."
Steller's sea cow went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.
"Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)."
"Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit."
"Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail."
"The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet."
"With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration."
"Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors."
"A leg is a weight-bearing and locomotive anatomical structure, usually having a columnar shape."
"During locomotion, legs function as ""extensible struts""."
"The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional ""hip"" joint."
As an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion.
The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot).
Most animals have an even number of legs.
"As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface such as the table top or chair seat."
"A toothbrush is an oral hygiene tool used to clean the teeth, gums, and tongue."
"It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristles, atop of which toothpaste can be applied, mounted on a handle which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth."
"They should be used in conjunction with something to clean between the teeth where the bristles of the toothbrush cannot reach - for example floss, tape or interdental brushes."
"They are available with different bristle textures, sizes, and forms."
"Most dentists recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate the gums.Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses and instead should be spat out, the act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom, where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for germ growth (and, if it is a wooden toothbrush, mold as well)."
"Some toothbrushes have plant based handles, often bamboo."
"However, numerous others are made of cheap plastic; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution."
Over 1 billion toothbrushes are disposed of into landfills annually in the United States alone.
"Bristles are commonly made of nylon (which, while not biodegradable, as plastic is, may still be recycled) or bamboo viscose."
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes  class Actinopterygii, known colloquially as flying fish or flying cod."
About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera.
"While they cannot fly in the same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface."
"The main reason for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others, though their periods of flight expose them to attack by avian predators such as frigate birds."
"Barbados is known as ""the land of the flying fish"", and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country."
"The Exocet missile is named after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take a low trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets."
"The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish, Potanichthys xingyiensis, dates back to the Middle Triassic, 235–242 million years ago."
"However, this fossil is probably not related to modern flying fish, which are thought to have evolved independently about 66 million years ago."
"The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the United States government tasked with  the enforcement of federal law and administration of justice in the United States."
It is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries.
"The department is headed by the U.S. Attorney General, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet."
"The current attorney general is Merrick Garland, who was sworn in March 11, 2021.The modern incarnation of the department was formed in 1870 during the Ulysses S. Grant presidency."
"The department is composed of federal law enforcement agencies, including the U.S."
"Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons."
"The primary actions of the DOJ are investigating instances of white collar crime, representing the U.S. government in legal matters (such as in cases before the Supreme Court), and running the federal prison system."
The department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local law enforcement as directed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
"Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory."
"Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology."
Rights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them.
"According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived""."
"A barnacle is a type of arthropod constituting the subclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea, and is hence related to crabs and lobsters."
"Barnacles are exclusively marine, and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters, typically in erosive settings."
"They are sessile (nonmobile) and most are suspension feeders,  but those in infraclass Rhizocephala are highly specialized parasites on crustaceans."
They have four nektonic (active swimming) larval stages.
"Around 1,000 barnacle species are currently known."
"The name ""Cirripedia"" is Latin, meaning ""curl-footed""."
The study of barnacles is called cirripedology.
"The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant."
The species originated in western South America and Central America.
"The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived."
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
"The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange."
"From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor."
"The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks."
"While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year."
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
"Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals."
"(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.)"
"The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width."
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time.
The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future.
"The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection."
"In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language."
"The first known use of the word ""past"" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning ""to pass."""
"A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion, such as unauthorized entry, into a building or other areas such as a home or school."
"Security alarms used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties protect against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders."
Security alerts in neighborhoods show a connection with diminished robbery.
Car alarms likewise help protect vehicles and their contents.
Prisons also use security systems for the control of inmates.
Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide fire and intrusion protection.
Intrusion-alarm systems are combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to record intruders' activities and interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.
There are many types of security systems.
"Homeowners typically have small, self-contained noisemakers."
"These devices can also be complicated, multirole systems with computer monitoring and control."
It may even include a two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and monitoring station.
"Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked."
"In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies."
"The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder."
"Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients."
"Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays."
"There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old."
"Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake."
The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles.
"The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet."
"Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC."
They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.
"Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music."
"They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a ""buzzing"" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument."
"Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in)."
"Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch."
"Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type."
"The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country."
A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.
"In physiology, respiration is the movement of oxygen from the outside environment to the cells within tissues, and the removal of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction.The physiological definition of respiration differs from the biochemical definition, which refers to a metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) by oxidizing nutrients and releasing waste products."
"Although physiologic respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration and thus life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes place in individual cells of the organism, while physiologic respiration concerns the diffusion and transport of metabolites between the organism and the external environment."
Gas exchanges in the lung occurs by ventilation and perfusion.
Ventilation refers to the in and out movement of air of the lungs and perfusion is the circulation of blood in the pulmonary capillaries.
"In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths."
Inhalation (breathing in) is usually an active movement that brings air into the lungs where the process of gas exchange takes place between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries.
"Contraction of the diaphragm muscle cause a pressure variation, which is equal to the pressures caused by elastic, resistive and inertial components of the respiratory system."
"In contrast, exhalation (breathing out) is usually a passive process."
"The process of breathing does not fill the alveoli with atmospheric air during  each inhalation (about 350 ml per breath), but the inhaled air is carefully diluted and thoroughly mixed with a large volume of gas (about 2.5 liters in adult humans) known as the functional residual capacity which remains in the lungs after each exhalation, and whose gaseous composition differs markedly from that of the ambient air."
"Physiological respiration involves the mechanisms that ensure that the composition of the functional residual capacity is kept constant, and equilibrates with the gases dissolved in the pulmonary capillary blood, and thus throughout the body."
"Thus, in precise usage, the words breathing and ventilation are hyponyms, not synonyms, of respiration; but this prescription is not consistently followed, even by most health care providers, because the term respiratory rate (RR) is a well-established term in health care, even though it would need to be consistently replaced with ventilation rate if the precise usage were to be followed."
During respiration the C-H bonds are broken by oxidation-reduction reaction and so carbon dioxide and water are also produced.
The cellular energy-yielding process is called cellular respiration.
"The Dogon (or Kaador, Kaado) are an ethnic group indigenous to the central plateau region of Mali, in West Africa, south of the Niger bend, near the city of Bandiagara, and in Burkina Faso."
"The population numbers between 400,000 and 800,000."
"They speak the Dogon languages, which are considered to constitute an independent branch of the Niger–Congo language family, meaning that they are not closely related to any other languages.The Dogon are best known for their religious traditions, their mask dances, wooden sculpture, and their architecture."
"Since the twentieth century, there have been significant changes in the social organisation, material culture and beliefs of the Dogon, in part because Dogon country is one of Mali's major tourist attractions."
"A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals."
"In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards."
"Some women with hirsutism, a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard."
"Throughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's fashion trends."
Some religions (such as Islam and Sikhism) have considered a full beard to be essential and mandate it as part of their observance.
"Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's virility, exemplifying such virtues as wisdom, strength, sexual prowess and high social status."
"In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor."
"In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements."
"Daiquiri  (; Spanish: daiquirí [dajkiˈɾi]) is a family of cocktails whose main ingredients are rum, citrus juice (typically lime juice), and sugar or other sweetener."
"The daiquiri is one of the six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, which also lists some variations."
Pole dance combines dance and acrobatics centered on a vertical pole.
"This performance art form takes place not only in gentleman's clubs as erotic dance, but also as a mainstream form of fitness, practiced in gyms and dedicated dance studios."
"Pole dancing enthusiasts are of all ages; although many who perform this dance and acrobatic form are adults, that does not stop younger children from learning and performing in competitions."
Amateur and professional pole dancing competitions are held in countries around the world.
"Pole dance requires significant muscular endurance and coordination, as well as sensuality."
"Today, pole performances by exotic dancers range from basic spins and striptease in more intimate clubs to athletic moves such as climbs and body inversions in the ""stage heavy"" clubs of Las Vegas and Miami."
"Dancer Remy Redd at the King of Diamonds, for example, is famous for flipping herself upside down into a split and hanging from the ceiling."
Pole dance requires significant strength and flexibility.
"Upper body and core strength are required to attain proficiency, and proper instruction and rigorous training are necessary."
"Since the mid-2000s, promoters of pole dance fitness competitions have tried to change peoples' perception of pole dance to include pole fitness as a non-sexual form of dance and acrobatics and are trying to move pole into the Olympics as pole sports."
Pole dance is regarded as a form of exercise which can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout.
Recognized schools and qualifications are now commonplace.
"An interrogative word or question word is a function word used to ask a question, such as what, which, when, where, who, whom, whose, why, whether and how."
"They are sometimes called wh-words, because in English most of them start with wh- (compare Five Ws)."
They may be used in both direct questions (Where is he going?)
and in indirect questions (I wonder where he is going).
In English and various other languages the same forms are also used as relative pronouns in certain relative clauses (The country where he was born) and certain adverb clauses (I go where he goes).
"It can also be used as a modal, since question words are more likely to appear in modal sentences, like (Why was he walking?)"
"A particular type of interrogative word is the interrogative particle, which serves to convert a statement into a yes–no question, without having any other meaning."
"Examples include est-ce que in French, ли li in Russian, czy in Polish, ĉu in Esperanto, কি ki in Bengali, 嗎/吗 ma in Mandarin Chinese, mı/mi in Turkish, pa in Ladin, か ka in Japanese, 까 kka in Korean, ko/kö in Finnish and (да) ли (da) li in Serbo-Croatian."
"Such particles contrast with other interrogative words, which form what are called wh-questions rather than yes–no questions."
"For more information about the grammatical rules for forming questions in various languages, see Interrogative."
The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom.
"British scientific intelligence at the Air Ministry fought back with a variety of their own increasingly effective means, involving jamming and deception signals."
"The period ended when the Wehrmacht moved their forces to the East in May 1941, in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union.The idea of ""beam"" based navigation was developed during the 1930s, initially as a blind landing aid."
The basic concept is to produce two directional radio signals that are aimed slightly to the left and right of a runway's midline.
Radio operators in the aircraft listen for these signals and determine which of the two beams they are flying in.
"This is normally accomplished by sending Morse code signals into the two beams, to identify right and left."
"For bombing, the Luftwaffe built huge versions of the antennas to provide much greater accuracy at long range, named Knickebein and X-Gerät."
"These were used during the early stages of ""The Blitz"" with great effect, in one case laying a strip of bombs down the centerline of a factory deep in England."
"Tipped off about the system's operation by pre-war military intelligence, the British responded by sending their own Morse code signals so that the aircraft believed they were always properly centred in the beam while they flew wildly off course."
The Germans became convinced the British had somehow learned to bend radio signals.
"When the problem became widespread, the Germans introduced a new system that worked on different principles, the Y-Gerät."
"Having guessed the nature of this system from a passing mention, the British had already deployed countermeasures that rendered the system useless almost as soon as it was used."
"The Germans eventually gave up on the entire concept of radio navigation over the UK, concluding the British would continue to successfully jam it."
A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.
"A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning."
Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory and other systems sciences.
"Knowledge is a familiarity or awareness, of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge) contributing to ones understanding."
"By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice."
The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.
"The term ""knowledge"" can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject."
It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); formal or informal; systematic or particular.
"The philosopher Plato argued that there was a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus, leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief""."
The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century.
"In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid."
"In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain."
"Only acoustic waves that have  frequencies lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, elicit an auditory percept in humans."
"In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 meters (56 ft) to 1.7 centimetres (0.67 in)."
Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans.
Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound.
Different animal species have varying hearing ranges.
"A ruby is a pink-ish red to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide)."
Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable.
Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires.
"Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, alongside amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond."
"The word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red."
The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium.
"Some gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the Black Prince's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown, are actually spinels."
"These were once known as ""Balas rubies""."
"The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value."
"The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality."
"After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated."
"Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually pinker than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies."
The world's most valuable ruby to be sold at auction is the Sunrise Ruby.
"Breakfast is the first meal of the day eaten after waking from the night's sleep, in the morning."
The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.
"There is a strong likelihood for one or more ""typical"", or ""traditional"", breakfast menus to exist in most places, but their composition varies widely from place to place, and has varied over time, so that globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast."
"Eggs are laid by female animals of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish, and many of these have been eaten by humans for thousands of years."
"Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes."
The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs.
Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten.
Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.
"Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline, and are widely used in cookery."
"Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid (now MyPlate)."
"Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content, salmonella contamination, and allergy to egg proteins."
Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry.
"In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens."
"There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production."
"In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
Rotex Electric is a Czech aircraft engine manufacturer based in Prague.
"The company specializes in the design and manufacture of electric motors for light aircraft, as well as for automobiles and other applications.The company was founded in 2003.The company produces four series of electric motors, REB, REG, RET and REX, in a variety of power outputs."
"The REB 90 is an example, a brushless 350 volt design that produces 80 kW (107 hp) for aircraft use."
Artemis is a 2017 science fiction novel written by Andy Weir.
"The novel takes place in the late 2080s in Artemis, the first and so far only city on the Moon."
"It follows the life of porter and smuggler Jasmine ""Jazz"" Bashara as she gets caught up in a conspiracy for control of the city."
"The novel was highly praised by readers on Goodreads, who voted it the best sci-fi novel of the year."
The novel's audiobook is narrated by Rosario Dawson.
Beine is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in north-central France.
The orbital plane of a revolving body is the geometric plane in which its orbit lies.
Three non-collinear points in space suffice to determine an orbital plane.
A common example would be the positions of the centers of a massive body (host) and of an orbiting celestial body at two different times/points of its orbit.
The orbital plane is defined in relation to a reference plane by two parameters: inclination (i) and longitude of the ascending node (Ω).
"By definition, the reference plane for the Solar System is usually considered to be Earth's orbital plane, which defines the ecliptic, the circular path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow over the course of a year."
"In other cases, for instance a moon or artificial satellite orbiting another planet, it is convenient to define the inclination of the Moon's orbit as the angle between its orbital plane and the planet's equatorial plane."
"A rechargeable battery, storage battery, or secondary cell (formally a type of energy accumulator), is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged into a load, and recharged many times, as opposed to a disposable or primary battery, which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use."
It is composed of one or more electrochemical cells.
"The term ""accumulator"" is used as it accumulates and stores energy through a reversible electrochemical reaction."
"Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network."
"Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used, including lead–acid, zinc–air, nickel–cadmium (NiCd), nickel–metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion polymer)."
"Rechargeable batteries typically initially cost more than disposable batteries, but have a much lower total cost of ownership and environmental impact, as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing."
"Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same sizes and voltages as disposable types, and can be used interchangeably with them."
Billions of dollars in research are being invested around the world for improving batteries and industry also focuses on building better batteries.
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
"In multicellular organisms, stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell."
They are the earliest type of cell in a cell lineage.
"They are found in both embryonic and adult organisms, but they have slightly different properties in each."
"They are usually distinguished from progenitor cells, which cannot divide indefinitely, and precursor or blast cells, which are usually committed to differentiating into one cell type."
"In mammals, roughly 50–150 cells make up the inner cell mass during the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, around days 5–14."
These have stem-cell capability.
"In vivo, they eventually differentiate into all of the body's cell types (making them pluripotent)."
"This process starts with the differentiation into the three germ layers – the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – at the gastrulation stage."
"However, when they are isolated and cultured in vitro, they can be kept in the stem-cell stage and are known as embryonic stem cells (ESCs)."
"Adult stem cells are found in a few select locations in the body, known as niches, such as those in the bone marrow or gonads."
"They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are multipotent or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell."
"In mammals, they include, among others, hematopoietic stem cells, which replenish blood and immune cells, basal cells, which maintain the skin epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, which maintain bone, cartilage, muscle and fat cells."
"Adult stem cells are a small minority of cells; they are vastly outnumbered by the progenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells that they differentiate into.Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Canadian biologists Ernest McCulloch, James Till and Andrew J. Becker at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the 1960s."
"As of 2016, the only established medical therapy using stem cells is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, first performed in 1958 by French oncologist Georges Mathé."
"Since 1998 however, it has been possible to culture and differentiate human embryonic stem cells (in stem-cell lines)."
"The process of isolating these cells has been controversial, because it typically results in the destruction of the embryo."
"Sources for isolating ESCs have been restricted in some European countries and Canada, but others such as the UK and China have promoted the research."
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a cloning method that can be used to create a cloned embryo for the use of its embryonic stem cells in stem cell therapy.
"In 2006, a Japanese team led by Shinya Yamanaka discovered a method to convert mature body cells back into stem cells."
These were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
A rainbow flag is a multicolored flag consisting of the colors of the rainbow.
"The designs differ, but many of the colors are based on the spectral colors of the visible light spectrum."
"When Isaac Newton first saw a rainbow through a prism, he labeled the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
"However, when not seen through a prism, the color he deemed ""blue"" is actually blue-green, or cyan, what he called ""violet"" is today known as dark blue, and ""indigo"" is a normal blue.The LGBT flag introduced in 1979 is the most recognized use of the rainbow flag."
Aggressive panhandling is a legal term for unlawful forms of public begging.
Proponents of such legislation advocate placing limits on these activities.
"Some opponents lament what they perceive to be the ""criminalization of homelessness"" and argue that such laws are discriminatory or unevenly enforced."
"Sheep dip is a liquid formulation of insecticide and fungicide which shepherds and farmers use to protect their sheep from infestation against external parasites such as itch mite (Psoroptes ovis), blow-fly, ticks and lice."
"Biologically, a child (plural children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty."
"The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority."
Children generally have fewer rights and responsibilities than adults.
They are classed as unable to make serious decisions.
"Child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age) or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the Sixties""."
"A food flavoring or food flavouring,
 in short flavoring or flavouring, or alternatively aroma is a food additive used to improve the taste or smell of food."
It changes the perceptual impression of food as determined primarily by the chemical senses of the gustatory and olfactory system.
"The ""trigeminal nerves"", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat, as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall perception of food."
"Of the three chemical senses, smell is the main determinant of a food item's flavor."
Aromas are the volatile components of the food.
The aroma of a food is determined by the aroma compounds it contains and the personal ability to detect them.
"While an aroma primarily acts through te olfactory system, it also affects the taste at the same time."
"Along with additives, other components like sugarsdetermine the taste of food."
"Five basic tastes – sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami (savory) are universally recognized, although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus (""fattiness"")."
"The number of food smells is unbounded; a food's flavor, therefore, can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar."
"This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies, soft drinks and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances."
The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists.
"A flavoring is defined as a substance that gives another substance taste, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc."
"Although the term, in common language, denotes the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same term is used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell."
"Owing to the high cost, or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorants are ""nature-identical"", which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials."
"Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as headspace techniques, so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present."
"In the EU legislation, the term ""natural-identical flavouring"" does not exist."
"The legislation is specified on what is a ""flavouring"" and a ""natural flavouring""."
A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste.
A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders.
"Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble."
"This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified;
from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified;
and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction."
Use of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses.
"Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace."
"European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes."
These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies.
"Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power."
"Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source."
"Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone."
"Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep."
"In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged."
"This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire."
Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower.
"These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts."
"Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power."
Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.
"Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls."
"While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live."
"As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible."
"From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose."
"A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state."
"In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected."
"The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or mostly ceremonial power, with others having complete control over the entire government."
"Historically, the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area, such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company."
These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces.
"There can also be non-political governors: high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management, styled governor(s), who simply govern an institution, such as a corporation or a bank."
"For example, in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, there are prison governors (""wardens"" in the United States), school governors and bank governors."
"The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial, from the Latin root gubernare."
"The obsolete term for a female governor is the female form governess, however the modern term for female officials is the gender-neutral form governor (without the gender-specific suffix -ess) to avoid confusion with other meanings of governess."
"A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with various uses."
"It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players."
"Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling."
"Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings."
Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.
"Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus."
The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame.
"Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials."
"As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word ""ball"" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects."
"""Ball"" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, making a fist into a ball."
"A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed  to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work."
"Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle."
Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles.
"Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators."
"In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a ""straight truck"" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a ""tractor"".The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico."
"The market-share of electrically-powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks."
"In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles."
Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing run on oval tracks measuring approximately 0.25 to 2.66 miles (0.4 to 4.3 kilometers).
"It originally used production-model cars, hence the name ""stock car"", but is now run using cars specifically built for racing."
It originates from the United States and Canada; the world's largest governing body is the American NASCAR.
Its NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top-level series of professional stock car racing.
"Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil and the United Kingdom also have forms of stock car racing."
Top-level races typically range between 200 and 600 miles (322 and 966 km) in length.
Top-level stock cars exceed 200 mph (322 km/h) at speedway tracks and on superspeedway tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
Contemporary NASCAR-spec top-level cars produce maximum power outputs of 860–900 hp from their naturally aspirated V8 engines.
In October 2007 American race car driver Russ Wicks set a speed record for stock cars in a 2007-season Dodge Charger built to NASCAR specifications by achieving a maximum speed of 244.9 mph (394.1 km/h) at Bonneville Speedway.
"For the 2015 NASCAR Cup Series, power output of the competing cars ranged from 750 to 800 hp (560 to 600 kW)."
The rough-skinned newt or roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa) is a North American newt known for the strong toxin exuded from its skin.
"Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series mainly adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga series, with exactly 500 episodes."
"It is set two and a half years after the original series in the Naruto universe, following the ninja teenager Naruto Uzumaki and his allies."
"The series is directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Pierrot and TV Tokyo."
"It began broadcasting on February 15, 2007 on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.On January 2, 2009, Viz Media and Crunchyroll provided eight uncut English subtitled Naruto: Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website."
"Later on January 15, Viz began providing subtitled versions of the latest Naruto: Shippuden episodes a week after they first aired in Japan, with a new episode being added to the Naruto website each subsequent Thursday."
"The English dub of Naruto: Shippuden made its US premiere on Disney XD on October 28, 2009."
"On July 24, 2009, Viz Media announced that the series would be released on the iTunes Store."
"The first DVD release of the series in North America was released on September 29, 2009.Naruto: Shippuden stopped airing on Disney XD on November 5, 2011 after 98 episodes, in which the network cited more frequent violence that was shown in later episodes."
DVD box sets generally containing thirteen dubbed episodes from episode 1 onward were released quarterly in their uncut format.
"The English dub was streamed on the Neon Alley web channel from its launch in October 2012, and beginning December 29, 2012 with episode 99, dubbed episodes premiered every week uncut until March 25, 2016 after 338 episodes, about a month before Neon Alley's closure."
"Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing the anime from the beginning on January 5, 2014 in an uncut format and as of 2021 it is still running on a weekly basis."
The network started showing never before aired dubbed episodes at the 339th episode mark by May 2021.
"In four regions, episodes from the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray by single volumes and box sets."
"In North America, twelve single volumes and thirty eight box sets have been released."
"In the United Kingdom, twenty eight single volumes and six box sets have been released."
"In Japan, twenty six sets of volumes have been released based on which arc it represents."
"In Australia and New Zealand, twenty-eight collections have been released."
"Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings."
"It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns."
"Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM sleep and non-REM sleep."
"Although REM stands for ""rapid eye movement"", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body."
"A well-known feature of sleep is the dream, an experience typically recounted in narrative form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy."
"During sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems."
The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night.
The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research.
"Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders."
The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.
One common source of artificial light are modern devices such as smartphones or televisions which have been shown to affect sleep health.
"Blue light, a specific type of artificial light, can disrupt the release of the hormone melatonin which aids in helping to facilitate sleepiness."
"A hubcap or hub cap is a decorative disk on an automobile wheel that covers at minimum the central portion of the wheel, called the hub."
An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture.
"It also has the function of decorating the car.A ""hubcap"" is technically the small cover over the center of the wheel, while a ""wheel cover"" is a decorative metal or plastic disk that snaps or bolts onto and covers the entire face of the wheel."
Cars with stamped steel wheels often use a full wheel cover that conceals the entire wheel.
"Cars with alloy wheels or styled steel wheels generally use smaller hubcaps, sometimes called center caps."
"Alternatively, wheel cover refers to an accessory covering an external rear-mounted spare tire (also known as a spare tire cover) found on some off-road vehicles."
"Elaphe quatuorlineata (common names: four-lined snake, Bulgarian ratsnake) is a member of the family Colubridae."
The four-lined snake is a non-venomous species and one of the largest of the European snakes.
"Abdominal pain, also known as a stomach ache, is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues."
Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome.
"About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis, leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, diverticulitis, or ectopic pregnancy."
"In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear.Given that a variety of diseases can cause some form of abdominal pain, a systematic approach to the examination of a person and the formulation of a differential diagnosis remains important."
"A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural orbital period of the Moon; the words month and Moon are cognates."
"The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (""lunations"") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days."
"From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age."
"Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year."
Short hair refers to any haircut with little length.
It may vary from above the ears to below the chin.
"If a man's hair reaches the chin, it may not be considered short."
"For a woman, however, short varies from close-cropped to just above the shoulders."
"Different styles of short hair include the bob cut, the crop and the pixie cut."
"Height is  measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how ""tall"" something or someone is) or vertical position (how ""high"" a point is)."
"For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m""."
"When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude."
"Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation.In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value."
"If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero."
"In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or ""above"") the x-y plane."
An aircraft pilot or aviator is a person who controls the flight of an aircraft by operating its directional flight controls.
"Some other aircrew members, such as navigators or flight engineers, are also considered aviators, because they are involved in operating the aircraft's navigation and engine systems."
"Other aircrew members, such as drone operators, flight attendants, mechanics and ground crew, are not classified as aviators."
"In recognition of the pilots' qualifications and responsibilities, most militaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots."
"Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae."
"They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush)."
"Twelve species belong to the monophyletic ""true foxes"" group of genus Vulpes."
"Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica."
The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.
"The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world."
"The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World."
"The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) is a species of hyena native to North and East Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent."
It is the only species in the genus Hyaena.
"It is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, as the global population is estimated to be under 10,000 mature individuals which continues to experience deliberate and incidental persecution along with a decrease in its prey base such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations."
"It is also the national animal of Lebanon.It is the smallest of the true hyenas and retains many primitive viverrid characteristics lost in larger species, having a smaller and less specialised skull."
"Though primarily a scavenger, large specimens have been known to kill their own prey, and attacks on humans have occurred in rare instances."
"The striped hyena is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs."
"A nocturnal animal, the striped hyena typically only emerges in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise."
"Although it has a habit of feigning death when attacked, it has been known to stand its ground against larger predators in disputes over food.The striped hyena features prominently in Middle Eastern and Asian folklore."
"In some areas, its body parts are considered magical, and are used as charms or talismans."
"It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it is referred to as tzebua or zevoa, though it is absent in some Bible translations into English."
Ancient Greeks knew it as γλάνος (glános) and ύαινα (húaina) and were familiar with it from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor.
"Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics."
Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring.
"The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand."
"Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass."
"The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology."
"Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material."
"Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures."
"Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria."
"The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience."
"Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses."
"In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles."
Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass.
"The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials."
"Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass)."
"The olfactory bulb (Latin: bulbus olfactorius) is a neural structure of the vertebrate forebrain involved in olfaction, the sense of smell."
"It sends olfactory information to be further processed in the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus where it plays a role in emotion, memory and learning."
The bulb is divided into two distinct structures: the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory bulb.
The main olfactory bulb connects to the amygdala via the piriform cortex of the primary olfactory cortex and directly projects from the main olfactory bulb to specific amygdala areas.
The accessory olfactory bulb resides on the dorsal-posterior region of the main olfactory bulb and forms a parallel pathway.
"Destruction of the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia, while irritative lesions of the uncus can result in olfactory and gustatory hallucinations."
"Forwards are the players on an association football team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals."
Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.
"Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards; for example, the common 4–2–3–1 formation includes one forward."
"Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards, or none."
"Planetary health refers to ""the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends""."
"In 2015, the Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet launched the concept as the Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on Planetary Health."
Skeletal muscles (commonly referred to as muscles) are organs of the vertebrate muscular system that are mostly attached by tendons to bones of the skeleton.
"The muscle cells of skeletal muscles are much longer than in the other types of muscle tissue, and are often known as muscle fibers."
The muscle tissue of a skeletal muscle is striated – having a striped appearance due to the arrangement of the sarcomeres.
Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles under the control of the somatic nervous system.
"The other types of muscle are cardiac muscle which is also striated and smooth muscle which is non-striated; both of these types of muscle tissue are classified as involuntary, or, under the control of the autonomic nervous system.A skeletal muscle contains multiple fascicles – bundles of muscle fibers."
"Each individual fiber, and each muscle is surrounded by a type of connective tissue layer of fascia."
Muscle fibers are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts in a process known as myogenesis resulting in long multinucleated cells.
In these cells the nuclei termed myonuclei are located along the inside of the cell membrane.
Muscle fibers also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs.
Muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils.
"The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments called myofilaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, which are the basic functional, contractile units of the muscle fiber necessary for muscle contraction."
"Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates, but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers."
These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.
"The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails."
"In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart."
"Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange."
Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species.
"Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing."
"In earlier tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians."
"In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm."
The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.
"Humans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung."
They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest.
"The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart."
"The lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier."
"The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone."
The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles.
"These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place."
Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts.
"Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli."
"Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction."
The inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes.
The right lung has three lobes and the left has two.
The lobes are further divided into  bronchopulmonary segments and  pulmonary lobules.
"The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation."
"The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancer."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances."
"A number of occupational lung diseases can be caused by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust."
Diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract.
"Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek πνεύμων ""lung"") as in pneumonia."
"In embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system."
When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe.
Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus.
"At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire."
The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.
A fellow is a broad concept whose exact meaning depends on context.
"In learned or professional societies, it refers to a privileged member who is specially elected in recognition of their work and achievements."
"Within the context of higher educational institutions, a fellow can be a member of a highly-ranked group of teachers at a particular college or university or a member of the governing body in some universities (such as the Fellows of Harvard College); 
it can also be a specially selected postgraduate student who has been appointed to a post (called a fellowship) granting a stipend, research facilities and other privileges for a fixed period (usually one year or more) in order to undertake some advanced study or research, often in return for teaching services."
"In the context of research and development-intensive large companies or corporations, the title ""fellow"" is sometimes given to a small number of senior scientists and engineers."
"In the context of medical education in North America, a fellow is a physician who is undergoing a supervised, sub-specialty medical training (fellowship) after having completed a specialty training program (residency)."
"Spanking is a common form of corporal punishment involving the act of striking, with either the palm of the hand or an implement, the buttocks of a person to cause them physical pain."
"Although the term spanking broadly encompasses the use of either the hand or implement, the use of implements can also refer to the administration of more specific types of corporal punishment such as caning, paddling and slippering."
Some parents spank children in response to undesired behavior.
Adults more commonly spank boys than girls both at home and in school.
"Some countries have outlawed the spanking of children in every setting, including homes, schools, and penal institutions, while others permit it when done by a parent or guardian."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats."
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
"Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures."
"Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball."
"Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities."
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
"The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers."
"In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit."
"Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g."
rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger.
"Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months."
"There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill."
"A skill is the learned ability to perform an action with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both."
Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills.
"For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job."
Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
"A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in the art of medicine or the art of war."
"Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts."
A practice is when the learned skill is put into practice.
"An art or skill may be the basis for a profession, trade, or craft."
People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy.
"A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it."
"Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual."
"The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively."
"The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other faiths."
"It appears in the form of an anthology, a compilation of texts of a variety of forms, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek."
"These texts include theologically-focused historical accounts, hymns, prayers, proverbs, parables, didactic letters, admonitions, essays, poetry, and prophecies."
The collection of materials that are accepted as authoritative by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon.
Believers generally consider the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration while understanding what that means in different ways.
The origins of the oldest writings of the Israelites are lost in antiquity.
There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon was settled in its present form.
"Some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty (140–40 BCE), while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later."
"The Masoretic Text, in Hebrew and Aramaic, is considered the authoritative text by current Rabbinic Judaism, but there is also the Septuagint, a Koine Greek translation from the third century BCE, which largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible."
"Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the ""Old Testament""."
"The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books, and soon the gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts coalesced into the ""New Testament""."
"In its first three centuries, the concept of a closed canon emerged in response to heretical writings in the second century."
A first list of canonical books appears in Athanasius' Easter letter from 367 AD.
The list of books included in the Catholic Bible was established as the biblical canon by the Councils of Hippo in 393 and in Carthage in 397.
"Christian biblical canons currently range from the 73 books of the Catholic Church canon, and the 66-book canon of most Protestant denominations, to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon."
"With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time."
It has had a profound direct influence on Western culture and history.
The study of the Bible through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well.
The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.
March is the third month of the year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
It is the second of seven months to have a length of 31 days.
"In the Northern Hemisphere, the meteorological beginning of spring occurs on the first day of March."
"The March equinox on the 20 or 21 marks the astronomical beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, where September is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere's March."
The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table (1858) is a collection of essays written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.
The essays were originally published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1857 and 1858 before being collected in book form.
"The author had written two essays with the same name which were published in the earlier The New-England Magazine in November 1831 and February 1832, which are alluded to in a mention of an ""interruption"" at the start of the first essay."
"The Lantern Festival (simplified Chinese: 元宵节; traditional Chinese: 元宵節; pinyin: Yuánxiāo jié), also called Shangyuan Festival (simplified Chinese: 上元节; traditional Chinese: 上元節; pinyin: Shàngyuán jié), is a Chinese traditional festival celebrated on the full moon, the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar Chinese calendar."
"Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar, it marks the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations."
"As early as the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE–25 CE), it had become a festival with great significance.During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns and solve riddles on the lanterns (traditional Chinese: 猜燈謎; simplified Chinese: 猜灯谜; pinyin: cāidēngmí)."
"In ancient times, the lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large ornate ones."
"In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs."
"For example, lanterns are now often made in the shape of animals."
"The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year."
The lanterns are almost always red to symbolize good fortune.The festival acts as an Uposatha day on the Chinese calendar.
"It should not be confused with the Mid-Autumn Festival; which is sometimes also known as the ""Lantern Festival"" in locations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore."
"Lantern Festivals have also become popular in Western countries, such as the Water Lantern Festival held in multiple locations in the United States."
"In London, the Magical Lantern Festival is held annually."
"A vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful, criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, degrading, deviant or perverted in the associated society."
"In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit."
Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality.
"Synonyms for vice include fault, sin, depravity, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption."
The opposite of vice is virtue.
Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus.
Hares are classified in the same family as rabbits.
"They have similar herbivorous diets, but are generally larger in size than rabbits, have proportionately longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs."
"They do not dig burrows, but nest in slight depressions called forms, often in long grass."
"Also unlike rabbits, their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless."
"Having long, powerful hind legs, most are fast runners."
"Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia, and  North America."
"There are five leporid species with ""hare"" in their common names that do not belong to the genus Lepus: the hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), and four species known as red rock hares (comprising Pronolagus)."
"In addition, several Lepus species are known as ""jackrabbits"" rather than hares."
"A hare less than one year old is called a ""leveret""."
"A group of hares is called a ""husk"", a ""down"", or a ""drove""."
Tenure is a category of academic appointment existing in some countries.
"A tenured post is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation."
"Tenure is a means of defending the principle of academic freedom, which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views."
"A curtain is a piece of cloth or other material intended to block or obscure light, air drafts, or (in the case of a shower curtain), water."
A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theater that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop/background.Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.
"For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons)."
"In this application, they are also known as ""draperies""."
Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portières.
"Curtains come in a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, colors, and patterns."
"They often have their own sections within department stores, while some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains."
"Curtains vary according to cleanability, ultraviolet light deterioration, oil and dust retention, noise absorption, fire resistance, and life span."
"Curtains may be operated by hand, with cords, by press-button pads or remote-controlled computers."
They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.
"Measuring curtain sizes needed for each window varies greatly according to the type of curtain needed, window size, and type and weight of curtain."
Curtains are a form of window treatment and complete the overall appearance of the interior of the house.
Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.
"The effect of drapery or curtains is best seen in daylight, and with proper indoor light positioning, can look attractive even at night."
"Transport (in British English), or transportation (in American English), is the movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to another."
"In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  
Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline, and space."
"The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations."
"Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations."
"Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations), and seaports."
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo.
"They may include vehicles, riding animals, and pack animals."
"Vehicles may include wagons, automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and aircraft."
"A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river."
"In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water."
"Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill."
"There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to  geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size."
"Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are ""run"" in some parts of the United States, ""burn"" in Scotland and northeast England, and ""beck"" in northern England."
"Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague."
Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle.
"Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from glaciers)."
"Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth."
They are made more obvious and significant to humans since many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams.
"Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were, used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as borders, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste."
"Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general."
"Vienna ( (listen) vee-EN-ə; Austrian German: Wien [viːn] (listen); Austro-Bavarian: Wean [veɐ̯n]) is the national capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria."
"Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 2 million inhabitants (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political center."
It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union.
"Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants."
"Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin."
"Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE."
"The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary."
These regions work together in a European Centrope border region.
"Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants."
"In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
"Additionally, Vienna is known as the ""City of Music"" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home."
"Vienna is also said to be the ""City of Dreams"" because it was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud."
Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city.
"It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century."
"The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.Vienna is known for its high quality of life."
"In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most livable cities."
"Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne."
"Monocle's 2015 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within""."
"Monocle's 2012 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within"" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010)."
The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most prosperous city in the world in 2012–2013.
"The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets."
Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners.
"Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions."
It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), commonly referred to as Berkeley Lab, is a United States national laboratory that conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department of Energy."
"Located in the hills of Berkeley, California, the lab overlooks the campus of the University of California, Berkeley."
Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products.
"In a domestic setting, soaps are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping."
"In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts."
"When used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned."
"In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins."
"It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.Soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base, as opposed to detergent which is created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer."
Humans have used soap for millennia.
Evidence exists of the production of soap-like materials in around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon.
"Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people, events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact."
"In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels, as well as novellas and short stories."
"More broadly, however, fiction has come to encompass imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games."
"A scarecrow is a decoy or mannequin, often in the shape of a human."
Humanoid scarecrows are usually dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops.
"Scarecrows are used around the world by farmers, and are a notable symbol of farms and the countryside in popular culture."
Hygiene is a series of practices performed to preserve health.
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases."""
Personal hygiene refers to maintaining the body's cleanliness.
"Hygiene activities can be grouped into the following: home and everyday hygiene, personal hygiene, medical hygiene, sleep hygiene and food hygiene."
"Home and every day hygiene includes hand washing, respiratory hygiene, food hygiene at home, hygiene in the kitchen, hygiene in the bathroom, laundry hygiene and medical hygiene at home."
"Many people equate hygiene with 'cleanliness,' but hygiene is a broad term."
"It includes such personal habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash clothes."
"It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including bathroom facilities."
"Some regular hygiene practices may be considered good habits by the society, while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful, or threatening."
"Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete formwork, etc."
"Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry."
"In the United States, 98.5% of carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999."
"In 2006 in the United States, there were about 1.5 million carpentry positions."
Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave.
Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old-fashioned carpentry is called timber framing.
"Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and South Africa."
"It is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program, which may be the case in many places."
"An hour (symbol: h; also abbreviated hr) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as 1⁄24 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599–3,601 seconds, depending on conditions."
"There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day."
The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of 1⁄12 of the night or daytime.
"Such seasonal, temporal, or unequal hours varied by season and latitude."
Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as 1⁄24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it 1⁄24 of the mean solar day.
"Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second."
"In the modern metric system, hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds."
"However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second, making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is based on measurements of the mean solar day."
Pink is the color of a namesake flower that is a pale tint of red.
It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century.
"According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance."
"A combination of pink and white is associated with chastity and innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction."
"A spider web, spiderweb, spider's web, or cobweb (from the archaic word coppe, meaning ""spider"") is a structure created by a spider out of proteinaceous spider silk extruded from its spinnerets, generally meant to catch its prey."
"Spider webs have existed for at least 100 million years, as witnessed in a rare find of Early Cretaceous amber from Sussex, in southern England."
Many spiders build webs specifically to trap and catch insects to eat.
"However, not all spiders catch their prey in webs, and some do not build webs at all."
"""Spider web"" is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use (i.e."
"clean), whereas ""cobweb"" refers to abandoned (i.e."
dusty) webs.
"However, the word ""cobweb"" is also used by biologists to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the family Theridiidae."
"While this large family is known as the cobweb spiders, they actually have a huge range of web architectures; other names for this spider family include tangle-web spiders and comb-footed spiders."
The term antelope is used to refer to many species of even-toed ruminant that are indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia.
"Antelope comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing all Old World ruminants that are not bovines, caprines, deer, or giraffes."
"One New World species, the pronghorn of North America, is sometimes colloquially referred to as the ""American antelope"", but they are more closely related to the Giraffidae family."
"The ""true antelope"" are the gazelle, Nanger, Eudorcas and Antilope.A group of antelope is called a herd."
"Unlike deer antlers, which are shed and grown annually, antelope horns grow continuously."
"In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint)."
It is the largest joint in the human body.
"The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation."
The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.
It is often termed a compound joint having tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components.
(The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)
A planet is a large astronomical body that is not a star or stellar remnant.
There are competing scientific definitions of a 'planet'.
"In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects."
"The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition."
"In the geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite."
"In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology and religion."
"Apart from the Moon, five planets are visible to the naked eye in the night sky."
Planets were regarded by many early cultures as emissaries of deities or as divine themselves.
"As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, and the invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of additional planetary objects that were diverse in size, shape and orbit."
"In 2006, the IAU adopted a resolution limiting the number of planets within the Solar System, though they are not followed by all astronomers, especially planetologists."
The IAU resolution is controversial because it excludes many geologically active objects of planetary mass due to where or what they orbit.
Ptolemy thought that the planets orbited Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
"Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested before, it wasn't until the 17th century that this view was supported by the concrete evidence, in the form of telescopic observations performed by Galileo Galilei."
"About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular."
"As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and that some shared such features as ice caps and seasons."
"Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observations by space probes have found that Earth and other planets share additional characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology."
The eight Solar planets in the IAU definition are divided into two divergent types: large low-density giant planets and small rocky terrestrial planets.
"In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the four giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."
"Six are orbited by natural satellites, the two exceptions being the innermost planets Mercury and Venus."
"Under geophysical definitions, the classification is more complex: the Moon and Jupiter's moons Io and Europa are additional terrestrial planets, but a large number of small icy planets are also added, such as the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto and the other large giant-planet moons such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan."
"Beginning at the end of the twentieth century, several thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars."
"These are referred to as ""extrasolar planets"", or ""exoplanets"" for short."
"As of 1 January 2022, 4,905 extrasolar planets have been discovered in 3,629 planetary systems."
The count includes 808 multi-planetary systems.
Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon.
"More than 100 of these planets are approximately the size as Earth, nine of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star."
"In 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f."
"A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates a minimum of 1.6 bound planets on average for every star in the Milky Way."
"As of 2013, one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"Applied mathematics is the application of mathematical methods by different fields such as physics, engineering, medicine, biology, finance, business, computer science, and industry."
"Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge."
"The term ""applied mathematics"" also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models."
"In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake."
The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.
"The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot"")."
"In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo."
Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.
"The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.As with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species."
"All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size."
"The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies""."
"The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size."
"There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region."
This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees.
"A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:

wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg;
tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);
wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smallest of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females;
kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head."
"Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development."
"Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals."
Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass.
"Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite."
"The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back."
"This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees."
The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
"Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful."
"The kangaroo is a symbol of Australia, appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force."
"The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references."
"Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land."
Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.
"A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of the celestial sphere."
"Globes serve purposes similar to maps, but unlike maps, they do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down."
A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe.
A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe.
A globe shows details of its subject.
A terrestrial globe shows landmasses and water bodies.
It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines.
Some have raised relief to show mountains and other large landforms.
"A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects."
"Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations."
"The word globe comes from the Latin word globus, meaning ""sphere""."
Globes have a long history.
"The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC."
"The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, made by Martin Behaim in 1492."
"The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire."
Sunglasses or sun glasses (informally called shades or sunnies; more names below) are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes.
"They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened."
"In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses).Since the 1930s, sunglasses have been a popular fashion accessory, especially on the beach."
"The American Optometric Association recommends wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation (UV) whenever a person is in the sunlight to protect the eyes from UV and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems."
"Their usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures, such as LASIK, and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas, when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK."
"It is important to note that dark glasses that do not block UV radiation can be more damaging to the eyes than not wearing eye protection at all, since they tend to open the pupil and allow more UV rays into the eye."
The Christian Hero is a 1735 tragedy by the British writer George Lillo.
It is based on the life of Skanderbeg who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century.
"Two years earlier William Havard had written Scanderbeg, another work based on his life."
"The original Drury Lane cast included William Milward as Scanderbeg, James Quin as Amurath, William Mills as Mahomet, Edward Berry as Osmyn, Sarah Thurmond as Hellena, John Mills as Aranthes, Richard Winstone as Paulinus and Theophilus Cibber as Amasie."
"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition."
"In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe."
In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.
"In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's  pouch."
It is not only mammals that give birth.
"Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them."
"Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals."

"Sea anemones are the marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria."
"They are named after the anemone, a terrestrial flowering plant, because of the colourful appearance of many."
"Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia."
"As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra."
"Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle."
"A typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the surface of the water."
The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth.
The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey.
They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells).
"In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells."
"Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit."
Sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through the mouth into the sea.
"The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, settle on the seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps."
"Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps."
"Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild."
"A secretary, administrative professional, or personal assistant is a person whose work consists of supporting management, including executives, using a variety of project management, communication, or organizational skills."
"However this role should not be confused with the role of an executive secretary, who differs from a personal assistant."
The functions of a personal assistant may be entirely carried out to assist one other employee or may be for the benefit of more than one.
"In other situations a secretary is an officer of a society or organization who deals with correspondence, admits new members, and organizes official meetings and events."
Grandparents are the parents of a person's father or mother – paternal or maternal.
"Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, etc."
"In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased."
"It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but largely results in the improved medical technology and living standard, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers."
"Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and nurture of children."
Grandparents are second-degree relatives to their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.
A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent).
"The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms gramps, granny, grandfather, granddad, grandmother, nan, maw-maw, paw-paw (and others which families make up themselves)"
Shweta Tripathi Sharma (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actress popularly known for the character of Golu Gupta in Mirzapur.
She began her film career as a production assistant and associate director and gained wider recognition and accolades for her acting performances in the Hindi film industry and web series.
Notable films include Masaan (2015) and Haraamkhor (2017).
Crown glass is a type of optical glass used in lenses and other optical components.
It has relatively low refractive index (≈1.52) and low dispersion (with Abbe numbers around 60).
Crown glass is produced from alkali-lime silicates containing approximately 10% potassium oxide and is one of the earliest low dispersion glasses.
"As well as the specific material named crown glass, there are other optical glasses with similar properties that are also called crown glasses."
"Generally, this is any glass with Abbe numbers in the range 50 to 85."
"For example, the borosilicate glass Schott BK7 is an extremely common crown glass, used in precision lenses."
"Borosilicates contain about 10% boric oxide, have good optical and mechanical characteristics, and are resistant to chemical and environmental damage."
"Other additives used in crown glasses include zinc oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, barium oxide, fluorite and lanthanum oxide."
"BAK-4 barium crown glass has a higher index of refraction than BK7, and is used for prisms in high-end binoculars."
"In that application, it gives better image quality and a round exit pupil."
A concave lens of flint glass is commonly combined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet.
"The dispersions of the glasses partially compensate for each other, producing reduced chromatic aberration compared to a singlet lens with the same focal length."
"A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a beacon for navigational aid, for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways."
"Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, rocks, and safe entries to harbors; they also assist in aerial navigation."
"Once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and has become uneconomical since the advent of much cheaper, more sophisticated and effective electronic navigational systems."
"Sledding, sledging or sleighing is a winter sport typically carried out in a prone or seated position on a vehicle generically known as a sled (North American), a sledge (British), or a sleigh."
"It is the basis of three Olympic sports: luge, skeleton and bobsledding."
"When practised on sand, it is known as a form of sandboarding."
In Russia sledges are used for maritime activities including fishing and commuting from island to island on ice.
"A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel frame using many coiled springs."
"Not all trampolines have springs, as the Springfree Trampoline uses glass-reinforced plastic rods."
People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.
"The fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the ""bounce mat"" or ""trampoline bed"") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy."
SOAP (formerly an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
"It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission."
"SOAP allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) to authenticate, authorize, and communicate using Extensible Markup Language (XML)."
"Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms."
A birthday card is a greeting card given or sent to a person to celebrate their birthday.
"Similar to a birthday cake, birthday card traditions vary by culture but the origin of birthday cards is unclear."
The advent of computing and introduction of the internet and social media has led to the use of electronic birthday cards or even Facebook posts to send birthday messages.
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.
Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.
Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996.
The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
"The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court."
The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
"The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively."
"Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack."
"An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point."
The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally.
"A few of the most common faults include:

causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;
catching and throwing the ball;
double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
net foul: touching the net during play;
foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body."
"A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures."
"The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945, respectively."
"The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict."
"In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland."
This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign that devastated 67 Japanese cities.
"The war in Europe concluded when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War."
"By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: ""Fat Man"", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon; and ""Little Boy"", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon."
"The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces  was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands."
"The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction""."
Japan ignored the ultimatum.
"The consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the Quebec Agreement, and orders were issued on 25 July by General Thomas Handy, the acting  Chief of Staff of the United States Army, for atomic bombs to be used against Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki."
These targets were chosen because they were large urban areas that also held militarily significant facilities.
"On 6 August, a Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima, to which Prime Minister Suzuki reiterated the Japanese government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on."
"Three days later, a Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki."
"Over the next two to four months, the effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on the first day."
"For months afterward, large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition."
"Most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison."
"Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki."
"The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war."
"Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings."
"Supporters believe that the atomic bombings were necessary to bring a swift end to the war with minimal casualties, while critics dispute how the Japanese government was brought to surrender, while highlighting the moral and ethical implications of nuclear weapons and the deaths caused to civilians."
"A pipefitter or steamfitter is a tradesperson who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains, and repairs mechanical piping systems."
Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices.
Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems.
"Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure, which requires metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting, threading, grooving, bending, and welding."
"A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable tap water in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere."
"Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded."
"Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.In Canada, pipefitting is classified as a compulsory trade, and carries a voluntary ""red seal"" inter-provincial standards endorsement."
"Pipefitter apprenticeships are controlled and regulated provincially, and in some cases allow for advance standing in similar trades upon completion."
"In the United States, many states require pipefitters to be licensed."
"Requirements differ from state to state, but most include a four- to five-year apprenticeship."
"Union pipefitters are required to pass an apprenticeship test (often called a ""turn-out exam"") before becoming a licensed journeyman."
Others can be certified by NCCER (formerly the National Center for Construction Education and Research).
"Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR, DPD) is a mental disorder in which the person has persistent or recurrent feelings of depersonalization or derealization."
Depersonalization is described as feeling disconnected or detached from one's self.
"Individuals may report feeling as if they are an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions."
Derealization is described as detachment from one's surroundings.
"Individuals experiencing derealization may report perceiving the world around them as foggy, dreamlike/surreal, or visually distorted.Depersonalization-derealization disorder is thought to be caused largely by interpersonal trauma such as childhood abuse."
"Adverse early childhood experiences, specifically emotional abuse and neglect have been linked to the development of depersonalization symptoms."
"Triggers may include significant stress, panic attacks, and drug use."
Those who do have this disorder could be in a depersonalized state for as long as a regular panic attack lasts.
"However, in some certain situations this state of mind could last either hours, days, and possibly even weeks at a time.Diagnostic criteria for depersonalization-derealization disorder includes persistent or recurrent feelings of detachment from one's mental or bodily processes or from one's surroundings."
"A diagnosis is made when the dissociation is persistent and interferes with the social or occupational functions of daily life.While depersonalization-derealization disorder was once considered rare, lifetime experiences with it occur in about 1–2% of the general population."
The chronic form of the disorder has a reported prevalence of 0.8 to 1.9%.
"While brief episodes of depersonalization or derealization can be common in the general population, the disorder is only diagnosed when these symptoms cause substantial distress or impair social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
A drawer  (listen) DROR is a box-shaped container inside a piece of furniture that can be pulled out horizontally to access its contents.
"Drawers are built into numerous types of furniture, including cabinets, chests of drawers (bureaus), desks, and the like."
The durian () is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio.
"There are 30 recognised Durio species, native to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand; at least nine of which produce edible fruit."
"Durio zibethinus, native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the only species available in the international market."
"It has over 300 named varieties in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia, as of 1987."
"Other species are sold in their local regions.Named in some regions as the ""king of fruits"", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and thorn-covered rind."
"The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres (12 inches) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs 1 to 3 kilograms (2 to 7 pounds)."
"Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species."
"Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering and unpleasant."
"The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, turpentine, and raw sewage."
"The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, led certain hotels and public transportation services in Southeast Asia to ban the fruit."
"However, the nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as ""a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds""."
"The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in Southeast Asian cuisines."
The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"A guide is a person who leads travelers, sportsmen, or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations."
The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.
"Behavior (American English) or behaviour is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems or artificial entities in within some environment."
These systems can include other systems or organisms as well as the inanimate physical environment.
"It is the computed response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.Taking a behavior informatics perspective, a behavior consists of actor, operation, interactions, and their properties."
This can be represented as a behavior vector.
"Flyleaf is an American rock band formed in Belton, Texas, in 2002."
"The band has charted on mainstream rock, Christian pop and Christian metal genres."
"They performed around the United States in 2003 before releasing their eponymous debut album, Flyleaf, in 2005."
The album went platinum after selling more than one million copies.
"Flyleaf released their second album Memento Mori on November 10, 2009; it debuted and peaked at No."
8 on the Billboard charts.
"Flyleaf's third album New Horizons was released on October 30, 2012."
"Shortly before the album's release, lead vocalist Lacey Sturm announced her departure."
Kristen May subsequently became the new lead vocalist.
"May sang with the band until August 2016, when she announced her departure from the band."
A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing.
"Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil."
"Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with."
"They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors."
These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.
"The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot"")."
"In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo."
Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.
"The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.As with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species."
"All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size."
"The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies""."
"The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size."
"There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region."
This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees.
"A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:

wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg;
tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);
wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smallest of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females;
kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head."
"Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development."
"Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals."
Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass.
"Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite."
"The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back."
"This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees."
The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
"Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful."
"The kangaroo is a symbol of Australia, appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force."
"The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references."
"Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land."
Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.
"Laughter is a pleasant physical reaction consisting usually of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system."
It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli.
"Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts."
"Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, or relief."
"On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh."
"Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation."
"Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling."
"Laughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations."
Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others.
"Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback.The study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology."
Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.
"It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south."
"It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi)."
"Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit."
"The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate."
"Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations."
"Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century."
The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.
Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century.
"Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party."
"Welsh national feeling grew over the century; a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962."
"Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998, the Senedd (the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales) is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters."
"At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population."
"Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including the capital Cardiff along with Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys."
The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population with Wrexham being the largest northern town.
The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated.
"Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism."
"In livestock farming, including dairy farming, Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency."
"Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain, and a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, but the country has retained a distinct cultural identity."
"Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west."
"From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the ""land of song"", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition."
"At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games, Wales has its own national team."
"At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete for the UK as part of a Great Britain team."
Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.
"A sailfish is a fish of the genus Istiophorus of billfish living in colder areas of all Earth's seas, which holds the record for the fastest speed of any of Earth's marine animals."
"They are predominantly blue to gray in colour and have a characteristic dorsal fin known as a sail, which often stretches the entire length of the back."
"Another notable characteristic is the elongated bill, resembling that of the swordfish and other marlins."
"They are, therefore, described as billfish in sport-fishing circles."
"A consumer is a person or a group who intends to order, orders, or uses purchased goods, products, or services primarily for personal, social, family, household and similar needs, not directly related to entrepreneurial or business activities."
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50.
Tin is a silvery-colored metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue.
Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort.
"When bent, the so-called “tin cry” can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state."
Pure tin after solidifying presents a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals.
In most tin alloys (such as pewter) the metal solidifies with a dull gray color.
Tin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements.
"It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains stannic oxide, SnO2."
"Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4."
"Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons."
"It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is β-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal; at low temperatures it is less dense grey α-tin, which has the diamond cubic structure."
Metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air and water.
"The first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of 1⁄8 tin and 7⁄8 copper, from as early as 3000 BC."
"After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced."
"Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, bismuth, and sometimes lead and silver, has been used for flatware since the Bronze Age."
"In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft solders, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide in optoelectronic applications."
Another large application is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel.
"Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as tin cans."
Some organotin compounds can be extremely toxic.
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions.
"This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word weal, which is from an Indo-European word stem."
"The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent."
An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy.
"Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts).At the most general level, economists may define wealth as ""anything of value"" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept."
Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.
"Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own."
"A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy."
"The United Nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets."
"Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals."
Human capital is the population's education and skills.
"Physical (or ""manufactured"") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure."
"History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning ""inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation"") is the study and the documentation of the past."
Events before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
"""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events."
"Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect."
"Historians  often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
"Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends."
History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
"However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the ""father of history"" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the ""father of lies""."
"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies."
"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
"Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)."
Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing.
"Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS)."
The granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers.
"Unlike general corporate debt, the credit quality of securitized debt is non-stationary due to changes in volatility that are time- and structure-dependent."
"If the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected, the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves; if improperly structured, the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss.Securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late 18th century to an estimated outstanding of $10.24 trillion in the United States and $2.25 trillion in Europe as of the 2nd quarter of 2008."
"In 2007, ABS issuance amounted to $3.455 trillion in the US and $652 billion in Europe."
"WBS (Whole Business Securitization) arrangements first appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, and became common in various Commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent business effectively gain the right to control the company."
"Canvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, shelters, as a support for oil painting and for other items for which sturdiness is required, as well as in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes."
"It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame."
"Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen, or sometimes polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although historically it was made from hemp."
"It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave."
Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck.
The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven.
"The term duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek."
"In the United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number system."
The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number 10 canvas is lighter than number 4.
"Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels."
"It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely."
"One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin."
"The word ""canvas"" is derived from the 13th century Anglo-French canevaz and the Old French canevas."
"Both may be derivatives of the Vulgar Latin cannapaceus for ""made of hemp"", originating from the Greek κάνναβις (cannabis)."
"A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed  to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work."
"Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle."
Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles.
"Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators."
"In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a ""straight truck"" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a ""tractor"".The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico."
"The market-share of electrically-powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks."
"In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles."
"A changing room, locker room, dressing room (usually in a sports, theater or staff context) or changeroom (regional use) is a room or area designated for changing one's clothes."
Changing rooms are provided in a semi-public situation to enable people to change clothes with varying degrees of privacy.
"Separate changing rooms may be provided for men and women, or there may be a non-gender-specific open space with individual cubicles or stalls, as with unisex public toilets."
"Many changing rooms include toilets, sinks and showers."
Sometimes a changing room exists as a small portion of a restroom/washroom.
"For example, the men's and women's washrooms in Toronto's Dundas Square (which includes a water play area) each include a change area which is a blank counter space at the end of a row of sinks."
"In this case, the facility is primarily a washroom, and its use as a changing room is minimal, since only a small percentage of users change into bathing suits."
Sometimes a person may change their clothes in a toilet cubicle of a washroom.
"Larger changing rooms are usually found at public beaches, or other bathing areas, where most of the space is for changing, and minimal washroom space is included."
Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls.
"Some do not have a roof, providing just the barrier necessary to prevent people outside from seeing in."
Chess is a board game played between two players.
"It is sometimes called Western chess, or International chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi."
"The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin."
"Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide."
Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
"At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns."
"The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ""check"") and there is no way for it to escape."
There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
Organized chess arose in the 19th century.
Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation).
"The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion."
A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
"Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology."
One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.
"In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov."
"Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory."
Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity.
Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.
"It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation."
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
"If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands."
"In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains."
"On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass."
"The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes."
"The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities."
"Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics."
Antarctica is the driest continent.
"The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in)."
Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
Rainfall is measured using rain gauges.
Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.
"Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water."
"Downtown is a term primarily used in North America by English speakers to refer to a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political and geographic heart."
It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD).
Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city’s employment.
"In some metropolitan areas it is marked by a cluster of tall buildings, cultural institutions and the convergence of rail transit and bus lines."
"In British English, the term ""city centre"" is most often used instead."
Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1.
Hydrogen is the lightest element.
At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2.
"It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible."
"Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter."
Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state.
Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds.
"For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons."
"In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang."
"The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.Hydrogen is nonmetallic, except at extremely high pressures, and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds."
Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules.
"In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+."
The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions.
"Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics."
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals.
"In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means ""water-former""."
"Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water."
"Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market."
"Hydrogen is problematic in metallurgy because it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight."
"The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning ""to pull, to draw""."
"Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as ""engines""), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units."
"Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons."
"Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails."
"Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport."
"Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables."
"Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before."
Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
"Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power."
"Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned."
The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.
"Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport."
"High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances."
"Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century."
"Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks."
"While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation."
"Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes."
"Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains."
Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.
"A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced."
"Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance."
"Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations."
"The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices."
The concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances or associated with traditions.
The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar.
"In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational functions as any other weekend days or activities."
"In many societies, there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions."
"For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith."
"In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed."
"For example, many people in England treat Bank Holiday as a ""working holiday"", changing very little of their daily routines for this day."
The word holiday has differing connotations in different regions.
"In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed day(s) of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, the word may refer to the period of time where leave from one's duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation."
"This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences."
The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws.
"Employers and educational institutes may designate ‘holidays’ themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with."
A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.
"It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision."
It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.
"In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion."
Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.
"These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells."
"Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs."
They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones.
This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.
"Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain."
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.
"Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways."
"This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates."
It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.
The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.
Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.
"The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article."
"The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract, including talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, humming or yelling."
The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source.
"(Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.)"
"Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx (voice box), and the articulators."
"The lungs, the ""pump"" must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds."
The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.
The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to 'fine-tune' pitch and tone.
"The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.)"
articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen or weaken it as a sound source.
"The vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate arrays of sound."
"The tone of voice may be modulated to suggest emotions such as anger, surprise, fear, happiness or sadness."
"The human voice is used to express emotion, and can also reveal the age and sex of the speaker."
Singers use the human voice as an instrument for creating music.
"A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide."
They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops.
"The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg.Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (Quercus robur), white oak (Quercus petraea), or American white oak (Quercus alba) and typically have standard sizes:

""Bordeaux type"" 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal),
""Burgundy type"" 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and
""Cognac type"" 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal).Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE."
"Someone who makes barrels is called a ""barrel maker"" or cooper (coopers also make buckets, vats, tubs, butter churns, hogsheads, firkins, kegs, kilderkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, pins, troughs and breakers)."
"Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol arrack, and sake."
"They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, and beer."
"Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails and tallow."
"Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space."
"The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium."
The barrel has also been used as a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity.
"For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal)."
Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal).
"A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels."
The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries).
"It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation."
"It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings."
"These are principles of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, the underlying process is frequently the same from one field to another."
"The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions."
"A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question."
"The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad."
Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies.
"A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations  agree with or conflict with the expectations deduced from a hypothesis."
": Book I, [6.54] pp.372, 408  Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's Large Hadron Collider."
"There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however."
"Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles."
"Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order."
"Sweatsuit is a compilation album by American rapper Nelly, released on November 22, 2005."
"The album consists of tracks from his 2004 simultaneous album releases, Sweat and Suit."
"The US edition of the compilation also includes four extra tracks, including the single ""Grillz"" featuring rappers Paul Wall and Ali & Gipp, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; along with The Notorious B.I.G."
"single ""Nasty Girl"", ""Tired"" featuring Avery Storm, and ""Fly Away"" from the soundtrack of the 2005 film The Longest Yard."
"Sweatsuit received positive reviews from critics, for containing the highlights from both Sweat and Suit, praising its material quality."
"Commercially, the compilation peaked at 26 on the US Billboard 200, and reached the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand."
"It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 copies."
"Myles Standish (c. 1584 – October 3, 1656) was an English military officer."
"He was hired as military adviser for Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts, United States by the Pilgrims."
Standish accompanied the Pilgrims on the ship Mayflower and played a leading role in the administration and defense of Plymouth Colony from its foundation in 1620.
"On February 17, 1621, the Plymouth Colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to re-elect him to that position for the remainder of his life."
"Standish served at various times as an agent of Plymouth Colony on a return trip to England, as assistant governor of the colony, and as its treasurer.A defining characteristic of Standish's military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action."
He led at least two attacks or small skirmishes against Native Americans in a raid on the village of Nemasket and a conflict at Wessagusset Colony.
"During these actions, Standish exhibited courage and skill as a soldier, but he also demonstrated a brutality that angered the Natives and disturbed more moderate members of the colony.Standish led a botched expedition against French troops at Penobscot in 1635, one of his last military actions."
"By the 1640s, he relinquished his role as an active soldier and became a farmer in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where he was one of the first settlers."
"He remained nominal commander of the Pilgrim military forces in the growing colony, but acted in an advisory capacity."
He died in his home in Duxbury in 1656 at age 72.
"Standish supported and defended the Pilgrims' colony for much of his life, though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church.Several towns and military installations have been named after Standish, and monuments have been built in his memory."
"He appears as lead character in the 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a highly fictionalized account which presents him as a timid romantic."
The poem was popular in the 19th century and played a role in cementing the Pilgrim story in American culture.
"A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity."
"A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it."
"The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see The Crown)."
A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules.
"Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of ""his"" federal government."
"""The Tortoise and the Hare"" is one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 226 in the Perry Index."
The account of a race between unequal partners has attracted conflicting interpretations.
The fable itself is a variant of a common folktale theme in which ingenuity and trickery (rather than doggedness) are employed to overcome a stronger opponent.
A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot.
Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion.
"The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with form originally being tied to function."
"Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against."
"Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are required footwear at industrial worksites."
"Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones."
"Contemporary footwear varies widely in style, complexity and cost."
Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost.
"High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for large sums of money."
"Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing, while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe."
"Traditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, but are increasingly being made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials."
"Globally, the shoe industry is a $200 billion a year industry."
"90% of shoes end up in landfills, because the materials are hard to separate, recycle or otherwise reuse."
"A port is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers."
"Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals."
"Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their respective histories.Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port."
"For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports."
"Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan."
"As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland."
"Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries."
"Ports can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution."
Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding.
"Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction."
"In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae."
It contains the pharynx and larynx.
"An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs."
"The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords."
"Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle."
"The ""throat"" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces.It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body."
"Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat."
"It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube."
The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs.
The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach.
Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue.
"The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat."
"The Jugulum is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast."
"The term Jugulum is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the Jugulum."
The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
"An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar."
"It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring."
"Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own."
"The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands."
"Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China."
"Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra."
The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
"As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets."
India currently hosts the largest tiger population.
"Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching."
"Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density."
The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna.
"It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams."
"The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea."
"A claw is a curved, pointed appendage found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes (mammals, reptiles, birds)."
"Some invertebrates such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine, hooked structures at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as they walk."
"The pincers of crabs, lobsters and scorpions, more formally known as their chelae, are sometimes called claws."
A true claw is made of a hard protein called keratin.
"Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense and grooming, in those and other species."
Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead.
Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs.
"In  finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency."
"Currencies are most commonly national currencies, but may be sub-national as in the case of Hong Kong or supra-national as in the case of the euro."
The exchange rate is also regarded as the value of one country's currency in relation to another currency.
"For example, an interbank exchange rate of 114 Japanese yen  to the United States dollar means that ¥114 will be exchanged for US$1 or that US$1 will be exchanged for ¥114."
"In this case it is said that the price of a dollar in relation to yen is ¥114, or equivalently that the price of a yen in relation to dollars is $1/114."
Each country determines the exchange rate regime that will apply to its currency.
"For example, a currency may be floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid."
Governments can impose certain limits and controls on exchange rates.
Countries can also have a strong or weak currency.
There is no agreement in the economic literature on the optimal national exchange rate (unlike on the subject of trade where free trade is considered optimal).
"Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations.In floating exchange rate regimes, exchange rates are  determined in the foreign exchange market, which is open to a wide range of different types of buyers and sellers, and where currency trading is continuous: 24 hours a day except weekends (i.e."
trading from 20:15 GMT on Sunday until 22:00 GMT Friday).
"The spot exchange rate is the current exchange rate, while the forward exchange rate is an exchange rate that is quoted and traded today but for delivery and payment on a specific future date."
"In the retail currency exchange market, different buying and selling rates will be quoted by money dealers."
Most trades are to or from the local currency.
"The buying rate is the rate at which money dealers will buy foreign currency, and the selling rate is the rate at which they will sell that currency."
"The quoted rates will incorporate an allowance for a dealer's margin (or profit) in trading, or else the margin may be recovered in the form of a commission or in some other way."
"Different rates may also be quoted for cash, a documentary transaction or for electronic transfers."
The higher rate on documentary transactions has been justified as compensating for the additional time and cost of clearing the document.
"On the other hand, cash is available for resale immediately, but incurs security, storage, and transportation costs, and the cost of tying up capital in a stock of banknotes (bills)."
"""Rocket 88"" (originally stylized as Rocket ""88"") is a rhythm and blues song that was first recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in March 1951."
"The recording was credited to ""Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats"", who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm."
The single reached number-one on the Billboard R&B chart.
"Many music writers acknowledge its importance in the development of rock and roll music, with several considering it to be the first rock and roll record."
"In 2017, the Mississippi Blues Trail dedicated its 200th marker to ""Rocket 88"" as an influential record."
"The song was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998,
and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018."
"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool."
"Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements."
"However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)."
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well."
"They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals."
"The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship."
"On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play."
"Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player."
A toy and a game are not the same.
Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction."
"Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both."
"Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role."
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures."
"The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games."
"A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural."
"Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources."
"Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature."
"The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery."
"At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes."
"Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to ""enchanted"" or ""magical""."
"It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy."
A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms.
"Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food."
"Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps."
"Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities."
"In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras."
The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
"The ( (listen)) is a grammatical article in English, denoting persons or things already mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers."
It is the definite article in English.
The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words.
It is derived from gendered articles in Old English which combined in Middle English and now has a single form used with pronouns of any gender.
"The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter."
"This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers."
"A backhoe—also called rear actor or back actor—is a type of excavating equipment, or digger, consisting of a digging bucket on the end of a two-part articulated arm."
"It is typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader, the latter forming a ""backhoe loader"" (a US term, but known as a ""JCB"" in Ireland and the UK)."
"The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the boom, while the section that carries the bucket is known as the dipper (or dipper-stick), both terms derived from steam shovels."
"The boom is generally attached to the vehicle through a pivot known as the king-post, which allows the arm to pivot left and right, usually through a total of 180 to 200 degrees."
"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a broad term used to group together these academic disciplines."
This term is typically used to address an education policy or curriculum choices in schools.
"It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area) and immigration policy.There is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular whether or not the science in STEM includes social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science."
"In the United States, these are typically included by organizations such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Labor's O*Net online database for job seekers, and the Department of Homeland Security."
"In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS (Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences), rebranded in the UK in 2020 as SHAPE."
"A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.)"
is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans.
"Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers, although the average bus usually carries between 30 to 100."
"The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads for double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads for midibuses and minibuses, while coaches are used for longer-distance services."
"Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare."
"Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, do not charge a fare."
"In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence."
"Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles."
"Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882."
"The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895."
"Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel."
"As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world."
"A baguette (; French: [baɡɛt] (listen)) is a long, thin type of bread of French origin that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law)."
It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.
"A baguette has a diameter of about 5 to 6 centimetres (2–2+1⁄2 inches) and a usual length of about 65 cm (26 in), although a baguette can be up to 1 m (39 in) long."
"In November 2018, documentation surrounding the ""craftsmanship and culture"" on making this bread was added to the French Ministry of Culture's National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage."
"In May 2021, France submitted the baguette for UNESCO heritage status."
"Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study."
A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian.
Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it.
It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms.
"So while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world, through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a cross-discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., geobiology has a strong multidisciplinary nature."
"Board games are tabletop games that typically use pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing surface) and often include elements of table, card, role-playing, and miniatures games as well."
Most feature a competition between two or more players.
"In checkers, a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces, while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores."
"Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team, and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person."
There are many varieties of board games.
"Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as Cluedo."
"Rules can range from the very simple, such as in Snakes and Ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader."
"The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets, but have great strategic depth."
A domestic worker is a person who works within the scope of a residence.
"The term ""domestic service"" applies to the equivalent occupational category."
"In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be ""in service""."
"Domestic workers perform a variety of household services for an individual(s), from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands."
Some domestic workers live within their employer's household.
"In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued."
"However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary."
"Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced."
"In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.Servant is an older English word for ""domestic worker"", though not all servants worked inside the home."
"Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called ""service"" and has often been part of a hierarchical system."
"In Britain a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the Victorian era, perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I."
"Lilium parryi, common name lemon lily, is a rare species of lily.Lilium parryi is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico where it grows in moist areas in mountain habitats."
In California it is currently known from the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains and a few remaining spots near Palomar Mountain to the south.
"It is the only true lily native to  Arizona, where a few populations can be found in the Huachuca, Chiricahua, and Santa Rita Mountains."
"In Mexico, it has been found in mountains in the states of Sonora and Baja California.Lilium parryi is a perennial herb growing erect to about 2 meters in height from a scaly, elongated bulb up to 11 centimetres (4+1⁄3 in) long."
"The leaves are generally linear in shape, up to 29 centimetres (11+1⁄2 in) long, and usually arranged in whorls around the stem."
"The inflorescence is a raceme bearing up to 31 large, showy, bright lemon yellow flowers."
"The trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers have six curling tepals up to 11 centimetres (4+1⁄3 in) long, sometimes with a few reddish spots."
There are six stamens tipped with large anthers up to 1.4 centimetres (1⁄2 in) long.
The pistil may be 10 centimetres (4 in) long.
"The flowers are pollinated by hawkmoths, especially Hyles lineata and Sphinx perelegans.Threats to this species include grazing, recreation, natural flooding and human alterations in water regimes, and horticultural collecting of the bulbs and flowers."
"Lilium parryi was named for Charles Christopher Parry (28 August 1823 – 20 February 1890), a British-American  botanist and mountaineer."
"Idyllwild, California, hosts the Lemon Lily Festival, which celebrates this species."
"The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder."
Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
"Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing."
"Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes."
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.
"Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order."
"In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property."
Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies.
"Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule."
"A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard."
"Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards."
"Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members."
The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.Numerous slang terms exist for the police.
Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies.
"One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession."
"A bell jar is a glass jar, similar in shape to a bell (i.e."
"in its best-known form it is open at the bottom, while its top and sides together are a single piece), and can be manufactured from a variety of materials (ranging from glass to different types of metals)."
Bell jars are often used in laboratories to form and contain a vacuum.
It is a common science apparatus used in experiments.
Bell jars have a limited ability to create strong vacuums; vacuum chambers are available when higher performance is needed.
They have been used to demonstrate the effect of vacuum on sound propagation.
"In addition to their scientific applications, bell jars may also serve as display cases or transparent dust covers."
In these situations the bell jar is not usually placed under vacuum.
A political party is an organization that coordinates candidates to compete in a particular country's elections.
"It is common for the members of a party to hold similar ideas about politics, and parties may promote specific ideological or policy goals."
"Political parties have become a major part of the politics of almost every country, as modern party organizations developed and spread around the world over the last few centuries."
It is extremely rare for a country to have no political parties.
Some countries have only one political party while others have several.
"Parties are important in the politics of autocracies as well as democracies, though usually democracies have more political parties than autocracies."
"Autocracies often have a single party that governs the country, and some political scientists consider competition between two or more parties to be an essential part of democracy."
"Parties can develop from existing divisions in society, like the divisions between lower and upper classes, and they streamline the process of making political decisions by encouraging their members to cooperate."
"Political parties usually include a party leader, who has primary responsibility for the activities of the party; party executives, who may select the leader and who perform administrative and organizational tasks; and party members, who may volunteer to help the party, donate money to it, and vote for its candidates."
There are many different ways in which political parties can be structured and interact with the electorate.
"The contributions that citizens give to political parties are often regulated by law, and parties will sometimes govern in a way that favours the people who donate time and money to them."
Many political parties are motivated by ideological goals.
"It is common for democratic elections to feature competitions between liberal, conservative, and socialist parties; other common ideologies of very large political parties include communism, populism, nationalism, and Islamism."
Political parties in different countries will often adopt similar colours and symbols to identify themselves with a particular ideology.
"However, many political parties have no ideological affiliation, and may instead be primarily engaged in patronage, clientelism, or the advancement of a specific political entrepreneur."
"In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it."
A woman is an adult female human.
"Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent)."
"The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as ""women's rights"" to denote female humans regardless of age."
"Typically, women have two X chromosomes and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause."
"Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva."
"The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males."
"Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men."
"Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women."
"With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education."
"Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men."
Some women are denied reproductive rights.
The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality.
"Trans women develop a gender identity that does not align with their male sex assignment at birth, while intersex women may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology."
Billionaire Boy is a children's fiction book written by David Walliams and illustrated by Tony Ross.
It was published on 28 October 2010 by HarperCollins.
"The story follows Joe Spud, who is the richest boy in the country and has everything he could ever want, other than a friend."
"The book was adapted for BBC television, broadcast on 1 January 2016."
"Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a non-profit organization, or a government body."
It is the art and science of managing resources.
"Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources."
"""Run the business"" and ""Change the business"" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend."
"The term ""management"" may also refer to those people who manage an organization—managers."
Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.)
Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.)
Master of Business Administration (MBA.)
"Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree."
"Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the Ph.D. in Business Administration or Management."
There has recently been a movement for evidence-based management.
"Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure:

Senior managers, such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization."
They set the strategic goals of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate.
"Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals and provide direction to middle management, who directly or indirectly report to them."
"Middle managers: examples of these would include branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to front-line managers."
Middle managers communicate the strategic goals of senior management to the front-line managers.
"Lower managers, such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work.In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization."
"Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership."
"A metal (from Greek μέταλλον métallon, ""mine, quarry, metal"") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well."
Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires).
A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride.
"In physics, a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero."
Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures.
"For example, the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure."
"Equally, some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals."
"Sodium, for example, becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure."
"In chemistry, two elements that would otherwise qualify (in physics) as brittle metals—arsenic and antimony—are commonly instead recognised as metalloids due to their chemistry (predominantly non-metallic for arsenic, and balanced between metallicity and nonmetallicity for antimony)."
Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (or are likely to be such).
"The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved."
"In astrophysics the term ""metal"" is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium, and not just traditional metals."
"In this sense the first four ""metals"" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, all of which are strictly non-metals in chemistry."
"A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime."
"Used in that sense, the metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.Metals, as chemical elements, comprise 25% of the Earth's crust and are present in many aspects of modern life."
"The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks."
"Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements.The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago."
"Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the 5th millennium BCE."
"Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys."
"A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball or softball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base —  the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run."
"In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number '5'."
"The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as he is often the closest infielder (roughly 90–120 feet) to the batter."
"The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base."
The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play.
The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territories.
"Third base is known as the ""hot corner"", because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction."
A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h).
"Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected, creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply."
"As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base."
"Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty."
Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.
"Expectations of how well a third baseman should be able to hit have varied a great deal over time; in the early years of the sport, these expectations were similar to those for shortstops, the third baseman being merely the less skilled defensive player."
"Players who could hit with more ability often were not suited for third base, either because they were left-handed or because they were not mobile enough for the position."
"However, the beginning of the live-ball era in the 1920s created a greater demand for more offense, and third basemen have since been expected to hit either for a high average (.290 or better) or with moderate to substantial power."
"Since the 1950s the position has become more of a power position with sluggers such as Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Ron Santo becoming stars."
There are fewer third basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame than there are Hall of Famers of any other position.
"Furthermore, with the notable exception of John McGraw and Bobby Cox, few third basemen have gone on to have successful managing careers, with Jimmy Dykes and Negro leaguer Dave Malarcher being perhaps the next most prominent managers who began their careers at third base."
"Must (from the Latin vinum mustum, ""young wine"") is freshly crushed fruit juice (usually grape juice) that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit."
The solid portion of the must is called pomace and typically makes up 7–23% of the total weight of the must.
Making must is the first step in winemaking.
"Because of its high glucose content, typically between 10 and 15%, must is also used as a sweetener in a variety of cuisines."
"Unlike commercially sold grape juice, which is filtered and pasteurized, must is thick with particulate matter, opaque, and comes in various shades of brown and purple."
The vestibulospinal tract is a neural tract in the central nervous system.
"Specifically, it is a component of the extrapyramidal system and is classified as a component of the medial pathway."
"Like other descending motor pathways, the vestibulospinal fibers of the tract relay information from nuclei to motor neurons."
The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head.
The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract.
"The function of these motor commands is to alter muscle tone, extend, and change the position of the limbs and head with the goal of supporting posture and maintaining balance of the body and head."
"Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people, events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact."
"In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels, as well as novellas and short stories."
"More broadly, however, fiction has come to encompass imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games."
Coller is a surname.
"Notable people with the surname include:

Amrose B. Coller (1885–1951), American politician
Jeremy Coller (born 1958), British businessman and philanthropist
Ray Coller (1907–1969), Australian rules footballer"
"A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod."
"The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs."
"However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into."
"When the word ""snail"" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails."
"Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs."
"Snails have considerable human relevance, including as food items, as pests, and as vectors of disease, and their shells are used as decorative objects and are incorporated into jewelry."
"The snail has also had some cultural significance, tending to be associated with lethargy."
The snail has also been used as a figure of speech in reference to slow-moving things.
The snail is the same or similar shape as the cochlea.
"A suit or lounge suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes."
It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes.
The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing.
"After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit."
A black lounge suit for professional occasions became known as a business suit and belongs to the day dress of the semi-formal wear dress code.Suits are offered in different designs and constructions.
"Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories."
A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat.
Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture.
"Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap."
"Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry."
"Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively."
"Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth."
"These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences."
"Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments."
"Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways:

bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available;
ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required;
suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options"
The Hunting Ground is a 2015 American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States and the reported failure of college administrations to deal with it adequately.
"Written and directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering, it premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival."
"The film was released on February 27, 2015, an edited version aired on CNN on November 22, 2015, and was released on DVD the week of December 1, 2015."
It was released on Netflix in March 2016.
"Lady Gaga recorded an original song, ""Til It Happens to You,"" for the film, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.The documentary focuses on Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, two former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students who filed a Title IX complaint against UNC in response to their rapes while enrolled."
"The use of Title IX in campus sexual assault cases became a model for universities across the country.Critics of the film, including writer Emily Yoffe and a number of Harvard Law School professors, have questioned The Hunting Ground's accuracy and objectivity."
(Harvard was one of the institutions criticized for minimizing the issue of sexual assault and protecting an alleged perpetrator.)
"Among the issues raised by critics are the film's portrayal of one man as a rapist, while not disclosing that the university and the police had found him not responsible for the alleged sexual assault, and for use of controversial statistics."
The filmmakers have actively defended their work.
"In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight."
"The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning ""to pull, to draw""."
"Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as ""engines""), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units."
"Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons."
"Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails."
"Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport."
"Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables."
"Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before."
Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
"Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power."
"Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned."
The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.
"Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport."
"High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances."
"Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century."
"Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks."
"While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation."
"Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes."
"Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains."
Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
"Scutellaria lateriflora, known commonly as blue skullcap, mad dog skullcap, and side-flowering skullcap, is a hardy perennial herb of the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to North America."
"It has an upright habit, growing 60 to 80 centimeters in maximum height."
"It is a wetland-loving species and grows near marshes, meadows, and other wet habitat."
The blue flowers are just under a centimeter long.
"Most of the flowers do not appear at the top of the main stem, but are produced along the length of side branches that grow from the leaf axils."
"In psychoanalysis, egosyntonic refers to the behaviors, values, and feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable to the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self-image."
"Egodystonic (or ego alien) is the opposite, referring to thoughts and behaviors (dreams, compulsions, desires, etc.)"
"that are in conflict, or dissonant, with the needs and goals of the ego, or, further, in conflict with a person's ideal self-image."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"Perspiration, also known as sweating, is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals.Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands."
"The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body and are responsible for secreting the watery, brackish sweat most often triggered by excessive body temperature."
"The apocrine sweat glands are restricted to the armpits and a few other areas of the body and produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion which then gains its characteristic odor from bacterial decomposition."
"In humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation, which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands."
"Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/min·m2), but is less in children prior to puberty."
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling.
"Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced."
"Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx."
"Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals, relatively few (exceptions include humans and horses) produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down."
Stetson is a brand of hat manufactured by the John B. Stetson Company.
John B. Stetson gained inspiration for his most famous hats when he headed west from his native New Jersey for health reasons.
"On his return east in 1865, he founded the John B. Stetson Company in Philadelphia."
"He created a hat that has become symbolic of the pioneering American West, the ""Boss of the Plains""."
This Western hat would become the cornerstone of Stetson's hat business and is still in production today.
"Stetson eventually became the world's largest hat maker, producing more than 3,300,000 hats a year in a factory spread over 9 acres (36,000 m2) in Philadelphia."
"In addition to its Western and fashion hats, Stetson also produces fragrance, apparel, footwear, eyewear, belts, bourbon, and other products evoking the historic American West."
Stetson University and Stetson University College of Law in Florida were named after John B. Stetson in 1899 for his contributions to the school.
A suitcase is a form of luggage.
"It is often a somewhat flat, rectangular-shaped bag with rounded square corners."
"Vinyl, leather or cloth suitcases may have a metal frame."
Hardshell suitcases open on hinges like a door.
"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system."
"The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs."
"In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles."
Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.
"Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers."
"In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow."
"The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid."
"The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node."
"These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart."
"The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle."
"From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide."
"Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide."
The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute.
"Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths."
Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke.
"Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others."
Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath.
"Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound."
"Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment."
"In zoology, a tentacle is a flexible, mobile, elongated organ present in some species of animals, most of them invertebrates."
"In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs."
"Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like muscular hydrostats."
Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding.
"Many are sensory organs, variously receptive to touch, vision, or to the smell or taste of particular foods or threats."
Examples of such tentacles are the eyestalks of various kinds of snails.
Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.
"A tentacle is similar to a cirrus, but a cirrus is an organ that usually lacks the tentacle's strength, size, flexibility, or sensitivity."
"A nautilus has cirri, but a squid has tentacles."
"A carousel (American English: from French carrousel and Italian carosello), roundabout (British English), hurdy-gurdy (Australian English, esp."
"SA), or merry-go-round, is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders."
"The ""seats"" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music."
"This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper (however see ‘direction of rotation’ below)."
"Other popular names are jumper, horseabout, horse tornado and flying horses.Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include a variety of mounts, for example pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns."
"Sometimes, chair-like or bench-like seats are used, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars."
"The ""roundabouts"" or ""merry-go-rounds"" installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices: simple, child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding."
Grandparents are the parents of a person's father or mother – paternal or maternal.
"Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, etc."
"In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased."
"It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but largely results in the improved medical technology and living standard, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers."
"Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and nurture of children."
Grandparents are second-degree relatives to their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.
A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent).
"The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms gramps, granny, grandfather, granddad, grandmother, nan, maw-maw, paw-paw (and others which families make up themselves)"
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
"The thumb is the first digit of the hand, next to the index finger."
"When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit."
"The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare hallux for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical."
Canada is a country in North America.
"Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area."
"Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border."
"Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver."
Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years.
"Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast."
"As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763."
"In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces."
This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom.
"This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom."
Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition.
"The country's head of government is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, who serves as head of state."
The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual at the federal level.
"It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education."
"It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries."
Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.
"A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index."
"Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks."
"Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States."
"In law, a hearing is a proceeding before a court or other decision-making body or officer, such as a government agency or a legislative committee.A hearing is generally distinguished from a trial in that it is usually shorter and often less formal."
"In the course of litigation, hearings are conducted as oral arguments in support of motions, whether to resolve the case without further trial on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, or to decide discrete issues of law, such as the admissibility of evidence, that will determine how the trial proceeds."
Limited evidence and testimony may also be presented in hearings to supplement the legal arguments.
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
"The Movement is an American reggae band originally formed in Columbia, South Carolina, in 2003."
"The two founding members, Josh Swain and Jordan Miller, then relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they acquired a live rhythm section in the form of local Philadelphia musicians Jay Schmidt and Gary Jackson."
The band has released six studio albums.
"Their music is commonly described as a fusion of rock, reggae, hip hop and acoustic music."
"A land mine is an explosive device concealed under or on the ground and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets, ranging from combatants to vehicles and tanks, as they pass over or near it."
"Such a device is typically detonated automatically by way of pressure when a target steps on it or drives over it, although other detonation mechanisms are also sometimes used."
"A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect, by fragments that are thrown by the blast, or by both."
The use of land mines is controversial because of their potential as indiscriminate weapons.
"They can remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended, harming civilians and the economy."
"Seventy-eight countries are contaminated with land mines and 15,000–20,000 people are killed every year while many more are injured."
"Approximately 80% of land mine casualties are civilians, with children as the most affected age group."
Most killings occur in times of peace.
"With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global movement to prohibit their use led to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known as the Ottawa Treaty."
"To date, 164 nations have signed the treaty, but these do not include China, the Russian Federation, and the United States."
"Bagger, packer, sacker or bag boy (US), is an unofficial title given to a courtesy clerk at a grocery store."
"A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, futton, or chesterfield (see Etymology below), is a piece of furniture for seating multiple people."
"It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows."
"Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping."
"In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den or lounge."
"They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars."
"Couches can also vary in size, color, and design."
"An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process."
The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process.
It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result.
An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.
Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field.
An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.
An inventor is a person who creates or discovers an invention.
"The word inventor comes from the Latin verb invenire, invent-, to find."
"Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists.Some inventions can be patented."
"The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful."
A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.
The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.
"Another meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others."
The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.
Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity.
"Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability."
"A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno-English: bun) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup."
"As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied."
"Coffee jelly (コーヒーゼリー, kōhī zerī) is a jelly dessert flavored with coffee and sugar."
"Although once common in British and American cookbooks, it is now most common in Japan, where it can be found in most restaurants and convenience stores."
Coffee jelly can be made using instant mix or from scratch.
It is served in restaurants and cafés.
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"The cat flea (scientific name Ctenocephalides felis) is an extremely common parasitic insect whose principal host is the domestic cat, although a high proportion of the fleas found on dogs also belong to this species."
"This is despite the widespread existence of a separate and well-established ""dog"" flea, Ctenocephalides canis."
Cat fleas originated in Africa  but can now be found globally.
"As humans began domesticating cats, the prevalence of the cat flea increased and spread throughout the world."
"Of the cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis felis is the most common, although other subspecies do exist, including C. felis strongylus, C. orientis, and C. damarensis."
Over 90% of fleas found on both dogs and cats are Ctenocephalides felis felis.
A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy.
"Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood."
"While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common."
A small amount of red wine is sometimes added for flavour.
Seasoning and flavourings may also be added.
"Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle."
Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow moist heat method.
This makes it popular in low-cost cooking.
"Cuts having a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry."
"Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing, or by using a roux or beurre manié, a dough consisting of equal parts of fat and flour."
"Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used."
"Stews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two."
"Generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat."
"While soups are almost always served in a bowl, stews may be thick enough to be served on a plate with the gravy as a sauce over the solid ingredients."
"Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that ""involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior""."
"The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology.Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime."
"As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory."
"Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:
Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined;
Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action."
"The Scottish Terrier (Scottish Gaelic: Abhag Albannach; also known as the Aberdeen Terrier), popularly called the Scottie, is a breed of dog."
"Initially one of the highland breeds of terrier that were grouped under the name of Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terriers."
They are an independent and rugged breed with a wiry outer coat and a soft dense undercoat.
"The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed ""the diehard""."
"According to legend, the Earl of Dumbarton gave this nickname because of the Scottish Terriers' bravery, and Scotties were also the inspiration for the name of his regiment, The Royal Scots, Dumbarton’s Diehard."
"Scottish Terriers, also known as Scotties, were originally bred to hunt vermin on farms."
They are a small breed of terrier with a distinctive shape and have had many roles in popular culture.
"They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie Fala is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, D.C., as well as by the 43rd president, George W. Bush."
They are also well known for being a playing piece in the board game Monopoly.
"Described as territorial, feisty dogs, they can make a good watchdog and tend to be very loyal to their family."
"Healthwise, Scottish Terriers can be more prone to bleeding disorders, joint disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer than some other breeds of dog, and there is a condition named after the breed called Scotty cramp."
They are also one of the more successful dog breeds at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with a best in show in 2010.
"A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an association of people, whether natural, legal or a mixture of both, with a specific objective."
"Company members share a common purpose and unite to achieve specific, declared goals."
"Companies take various forms, such as:

voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations
business entities, whose aim is generating profit
financial entities and banks
programs or educational institutions.A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability as members perform or fail to discharge their duty according to the publicly declared incorporation, or published policy."
"When a company closes, it may need to be liquidated to avoid further legal obligations."
Companies may associate and collectively register themselves as new companies; the resulting entities are often known as corporate groups.
"Mediation  is a structured, interactive process where an impartial third party assists disputing parties in resolving conflict through the use of specialized communication and negotiation techniques."
All participants in mediation are encouraged to actively participate in the process.
"Mediation is a ""party-centered"" process in that it is focused primarily upon the needs, rights, and interests of the parties."
The mediator uses a wide variety of techniques to guide the process in a constructive direction and to help the parties find their optimal solution.
A mediator is facilitative in that she/he manages the interaction between parties and facilitates open communication.
"Mediation is also evaluative in that the mediator analyzes issues and relevant norms (""reality-testing""), while refraining from providing prescriptive advice to the parties (e.g., ""You should do..."")."
"Mediation, as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution resolving disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects."
"Typically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a settlement."
"Disputants may mediate disputes in a variety of domains, such as commercial, legal, diplomatic, workplace, community, and family matters."
The term mediation broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach an agreement.
"More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable, and dynamics that ""ordinary"" negotiation lacks."
"The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law."
Participation is typically voluntary.
The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs the process.
Mediation is becoming a more peaceful and internationally accepted solution to end the conflict.
Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of any magnitude.
"The term mediation, however, due to language as well as national legal standards and regulations is not identical in content in all countries but rather has specific connotations, and there are some differences between Anglo-Saxon definitions and other countries, especially countries with a civil, statutory law tradition.Mediators use various techniques to open, or improve, dialogue and empathy between disputants, aiming to help the parties reach an agreement."
Much depends on the mediator's skill and training.
"As the practice gained popularity, training programs, certifications, and licensing followed, which produced trained and professional mediators committed to the discipline."
"Safety signs are a type of sign designed to warn of hazards, indicate mandatory actions or required use of Personal protective equipment, prohibit actions or objects, identify the location of firefighting or safety equipment, or marking of exit routes."
"In addition to being encountered in industrial facilities; safety signs are also found in public places and communities, at electrical pylons and Electrical substations, cliffs, beaches, bodies of water, on motorized equipment, such as lawn mowers, and areas closed for construction or demolition."
"Onionskin or onion skin is a thin, lightweight, strong, often translucent paper."
"Though not made from onions, it superficially resembles their thin, papery skins."
"It was usually used with carbon paper for typing duplicates in a typewriter, for permanent records where low bulk was important, or for airmail correspondence."
"It is typically 25–39 g/m2 (9-pound basis weight in US units), and may be white or canary-colored."
"In the typewriter era, onion skin often had a deeply textured cockle finish which allowed for easier erasure of typing mistakes, but other glazed and unglazed finishes were also available then and may be more common today."
Onionskin paper is relatively durable and lightweight due to its high content of cotton fibers.
"Because of these attributes and its crispness when folding, onionskin paper is one of the best papers to use for toy kites and advanced paper airplanes."
Paper airplanes made from onionskin paper tend to fly very well due to their low weight and high integrity once folded.
Onionskin paper has also been regularly used in traditional cel animation.
"Due to its translucency, it is used as a guide in drawing the frames between key-frames."
"This is a process that animators refer to as ""in-betweening""."
"The process of ""onionskinning"" is also used in digital animation where frames are represented by digital layers in a production."
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.
"It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology."
It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
"For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics)."
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
"There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g."
"hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc."
"General Baptists are Baptists who hold the general or unlimited atonement view, the belief that Jesus Christ died for the entire world and not just for the chosen elect."
"General Baptists are theologically Arminian, which distinguishes them from Reformed Baptists (also known as ""Particular Baptists"" for their belief in particular redemption).Free Will Baptists are General Baptists; opponents of the English General Baptists in North Carolina dubbed them ""Freewillers"" and they later assumed the name.General Baptist denominations have explicated their faith in two major confessions of faith, ""The Standard Confession"" (1660), and ""The Orthodox Creed"" (1678)."
"Positive feedback (exacerbating feedback, self-reinforcing feedback) is a process that occurs in a feedback loop which exacerbates the effects of a small disturbance."
"That is, the effects of a perturbation on a system include an increase in the magnitude of the perturbation."
"That is, A produces more of B which in turn produces more of A."
"In contrast, a system in which the results of a change act to reduce or counteract it has negative feedback."
"Both concepts play an important role in science and engineering, including biology, chemistry, and cybernetics."
"Mathematically, positive feedback is defined as a positive loop gain around a closed loop of cause and effect."
"That is, positive feedback is in phase with the input, in the sense that it adds to make the input larger."
Positive feedback tends to cause system instability.
"When the loop gain is positive and above 1, there will typically be exponential growth, increasing oscillations, chaotic behavior or other divergences from equilibrium."
"System parameters will typically accelerate towards extreme values, which may damage or destroy the system, or may end with the system latched into a new stable state."
"Positive feedback may be controlled by signals in the system being filtered, damped, or limited, or it can be cancelled or reduced by adding negative feedback."
Positive feedback is used in digital electronics to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into '0' and '1' states.
"On the other hand, thermal runaway is a type of positive feedback that can destroy semiconductor junctions."
"Positive feedback in chemical reactions can increase the rate of reactions, and in some cases can lead to explosions."
"Positive feedback in mechanical design causes tipping-point, or 'over-centre', mechanisms to snap into position, for example in switches and locking pliers."
"Out of control, it can cause bridges to collapse."
Positive feedback in economic systems can cause boom-then-bust cycles.
"A familiar example of positive feedback is the loud squealing or howling sound produced by audio feedback in public address systems: the microphone picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again."
"Gothic fiction, sometimes called Gothic horror in the 20th century, is a genre of literature and film that covers horror, death, and at times, romance."
"It is said to derive from the English author Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, later subtitled ""A Gothic Story""."
"Early contributors included Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis."
It tends to stress emotion and a pleasurable terror that expands the Romantic literature of the time.
"The common ""pleasures"" were the sublime, which indescribably ""takes us beyond ourselves."""
"Such extreme Romanticism was popular throughout Europe, especially among English and German-language authors."
"Its 19th-century success peaked with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and work by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Dickens, and in poetry with Samuel Taylor Coleridge."
"Also prominent was the later Dracula by Bram Stoker, Richard Marsh's The Beetle and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson."
"The name Gothic spread from the Goths to mean ""German""."
"It also draws in Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages, where many of the stories occur."
"Twentieth-century contributors include Daphne du Maurier, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice and Toni Morrison."
A wish is a hope or desire for something.
"In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices."
"In folklore, opportunities for ""making a wish"" or for wishes to ""come true"" or ""be granted"" are themes that are sometimes used."
A volcanic crater is an approximately circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity.
It is typically a bowl-shaped feature within which contains either multiple vents or a singular vent.
"During volcanic eruptions, molten magma and volcanic gases  rise from an underground magma chamber, through a tube-shaped conduit, until they reach the crater's vent, from where the gases escape into the atmosphere and the magma is erupted as lava."
"A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth."
"During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger depression known as a caldera."
"In the anatomy of humans and homologous primates, the descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon."
The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.
The descending colon is on the left side of the body (barring any malformations).
The term left colon is hypernymous to descending colon in precise use; many casual mentions of the left colon chiefly concern the descending colon.
"An umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs that is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole."
It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight.
"The term umbrella is traditionally used when protecting oneself from rain, with parasol used when protecting oneself from sunlight, though the terms continue to be used interchangeably."
"Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof, and some umbrellas are transparent."
Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic.
"There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are called en-tout-cas (French for ""in any case"").Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use."
The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas.
"Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag, and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed."
"Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which spring open at the press of a button."
"Hand-held umbrellas have a type of handle which can be made from wood, a plastic cylinder or a bent ""crook"" handle (like the handle of a cane)."
"Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at discount stores to expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models."
"Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach."
Parasols are occasionally called sunshades.
"An umbrella may also be called a brolly (UK slang), parapluie (nineteenth century, French origin), rainshade, gamp (British, informal, dated), or bumbershoot (rare, facetious American slang)."
"When used for snow, it is called a paraneige."
"In mathematics and computer science, apply is a function that applies a function to arguments."
"It is central to programming languages derived from lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme, and also in functional languages."
"It has a role in the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs, because it is a continuous function on complete partial orders."
"Apply is also a continuous function in homotopy theory, and, indeed underpins the entire theory: it allows a homotopy deformation to be viewed as a continuous path in the space of functions."
"Likewise, valid mutations (refactorings) of computer programs can be seen as those that are ""continuous"" in the Scott topology."
"The most general setting for apply is in category theory, where it is right adjoint to currying in closed monoidal categories."
"A special case of this are the Cartesian closed categories, whose internal language is simply typed lambda calculus."
"In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (that is, eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence."
They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function).
"For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively."
"In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant."
"Limit inferior is also called infimum limit, limit infimum, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit."
"The limit inferior of a sequence

"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
"In mathematics, a group is a set equipped with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and is such that every element has an inverse."
"These three conditions, called group axioms, hold for number systems and many other mathematical structures."
"For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group."
"The formulation of the axioms is, however, detached from the concrete nature of the group and its operation."
"This allows one to handle entities of very different mathematical origins in a flexible way, while retaining essential structural aspects of many mathematical objects."
"The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas—both within and outside mathematics—makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.Groups arise naturally in geometry for the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: the symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form generally a group."
These examples were at the origin of the concept of group (together with Galois groups).
Lie groups arise as symmetry groups in geometry but appear also in the Standard Model of particle physics.
The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity.
Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry.
"The concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s, who introduced the term group (groupe, in French) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group."
"After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870."
Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.
"To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups."
"In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory."
"A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004."
"Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory."
Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears.
"They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound."
"Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear."
"Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans."
Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.
"Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal."
"A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open."
"In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone."
"Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM radio."
"The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free."
Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.Headphones exhibit a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.
Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles.
Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source.
"Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players."
"As a result of the Walkman effect beginning in the 1980s, headphones started to be used in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit."
"Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees."
The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Experience refers to conscious events in general, more specifically to perceptions, or to the practical knowledge and familiarity that is produced by these conscious processes."
"Understood as a conscious event in the widest sense, experience involves a subject to which various items are presented."
"In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch presents the subject with the objects ""bird"" and ""branch"", the relation between them and the property ""yellow""."
"Unreal items may be included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or dreams."
"When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience."
"In this sense, experience is usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of conscious events, like thinking or imagining."
"In a slightly different sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce."
"In this sense, it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world is the source of knowledge."
"So an experienced hiker is someone who actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many books about hiking."
This is associated both with recurrent past acquaintance and the abilities learned through them.
"Many scholarly debates on the nature of experience focus on experience as conscious event, either in the wide or the more restricted sense."
"One important topic in this field is the question of whether all experiences are intentional, i.e."
are directed at objects different from themselves.
"Another debate focuses on the question of whether there are non-conceptual experiences and, if so, what role they could play in justifying beliefs."
"Some theorists claim that experiences are transparent, meaning that what an experience feels like only depends on the contents presented in this experience."
Other theorists reject this claim by pointing out that what matters is not just what is presented but also how it is presented.
A great variety of types of experiences is discussed in the academic literature.
"Perceptual experiences, for example, represent the external world through stimuli registered and transmitted by the senses."
"The experience of episodic memory, on the other hand, involves reliving a past event one experienced before."
"In imaginative experience, objects are presented without aiming to show how things actually are."
"The experience of thinking involves mental representations and the processing of information, in which ideas or propositions are entertained, judged or connected."
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good.
"It is closely related to emotional experience, which has additionally evaluative, physiological and behavioral components."
"Moods are similar to emotions, with one key difference being that they lack a specific object found in emotions."
Conscious desires involve the experience of wanting something.
"They play a central role in the experience of agency, in which intentions are formed, courses of action are planned, and decisions are taken and realized."
"Non-ordinary experience refers to rare experiences that significantly differ from the experience in the ordinary waking state, like religious experiences, out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences."
Experience is discussed in various disciplines.
Phenomenology is the science of the structure and contents of experience.
"It uses different methods, like epoché or eidetic variation."
Sensory experience is of special interest to epistemology.
"An important traditional discussion in this field concerns whether all knowledge is based on sensory experience, as empiricists claim, or not, as rationalists contend."
"This is closely related to the role of experience in science, in which experience is said to act as a neutral arbiter between competing theories."
"In metaphysics, experience is involved in the mind-body problem and the hard problem of consciousness, both of which try to explain the relation between matter and experience."
"In psychology, some theorists hold that all concepts are learned from experience while others argue that some concepts are innate."
Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
"Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria)."
"By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for ""green plants""), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae."
Most plants are multicellular organisms.
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.
"Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color."
"Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds."
"Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common."
"There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds."
"Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems."
"Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia."
"Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs."
"The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology."
"The raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family, most of which are in the subgenus Idaeobatus."
The name also applies to these plants themselves.
Raspberries are perennial with woody stems.
"World production of raspberries in 2019 was 822,493 tonnes, led by Russia with approximately 21% of the total."
"Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians."
"Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope."
"Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes)."
"Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons."
Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
"Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys."
"Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago."
New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago.
Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.
"Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35–32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini)."
"The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys."
"Apes emerged within ""monkeys"" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well."
"There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""Old World monkey"" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes)."
"That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers."
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid.
"Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils."
A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio.
The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing.
A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.
"Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils."
"Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics."
"Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines."
The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
"Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel."
A male that has been castrated is a capon.
An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
"Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)."
Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
"Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011."
There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
"There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature."
"Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent."
"From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC."
"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."
"The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family."
Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.
"The violin typically has four strings, (some can have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings."
"It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno)."
Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres.
"They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments."
"Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz."
"Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound."
"The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music."
The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it.
"The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection."
"In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria."
"According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed."
"Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial ""trade violins"" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt."
"Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers."
The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood.
"Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings."
A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker.
One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker.
Winter squash is an annual fruit representing several squash species within the genus Cucurbita.
It differs from summer squash in that it is harvested and eaten in the mature stage when the seeds within have matured fully and the skin has hardened into a tough rind.
"At this stage, most varieties of this vegetable can be stored for use during the winter."
"Winter squash is generally cooked before being eaten, and the skin or rind is not usually eaten as it is with summer squash.Cultivars of winter squash that are round and orange are called pumpkins."
"In New Zealand and Australian English, the term ""pumpkin"" generally refers to the broader category called ""winter squash""."
"Streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as strep throat, is an infection of the back of the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS)."
"Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils (tonsilitis), and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck."
"A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur."
Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever.
Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.Strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person.
"It may be spread directly or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes."
Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.
It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep.
The diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.Prevention is by washing hands and not sharing eating utensils.
There is no vaccine for the disease.
Treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis.
Those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment.
Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.Strep throat is a common bacterial infection in children.
It is the cause of 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults.
Cases are more common in late winter and early spring.
Potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.
"A trail is usually a path, track or unpaved lane or road."
"In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, path or footpath is the preferred term for a walking trail."
"The term is also applied in North America to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways."
"In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by emigrants (e.g."
the Oregon Trail).
"In the USA ""trace"" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace."
"Some trails are single use and can be used only for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use, and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians."
"There are also unpaved trails used by dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles, and in some places, like the Alps, trails are used for moving cattle and other livestock."
"Eragrostis is a large and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found in many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands.Eragrostis is commonly known as lovegrass or canegrass."
"The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words ἔρως (eros), meaning ""love"", and ἄγρωστις (agrostis), meaning ""grass"".Lovegrass is commonly used as livestock fodder."
"The seeds appear to be of high nutritional value for some animals, but they are also very tiny and collecting them for human food is cumbersome and hence uncommon."
"A notable exception is teff (E. tef), which is used to make traditional breads on the Horn of Africa, such as Ethiopian injera and Somalian laxoox."
It is a crop of commercial importance.
"E. clelandii and E. tremula are recorded as famine foods in Australia and Chad, respectively.Other species, such as E. amabilis, are used as ornamental plants."
E. cynosuroides is used in the pūjā rites in the Hindu temple at Karighatta.
Bahia lovegrass (E. bahiensis) is known as a hyperaccumulator of caesium-137 and can be grown to remove the highly toxic radioactive atoms from the environment.
Weeping lovegrass (E. curvula) has been planted extensively to prevent soil erosion.
"Seed dispersal is often done by passing animals; the grains' hooks latch on to fur or hair, or to clothes."
Others are wind or gravity dispersed.
"Several herbivores feed on lovegrass, including invertebrates such as the caterpillars of the Zabulon skipper (Poanes zabulon) and vertebrates."
The extinct bluebuck (Hippotragus leucophaeus) was known to graze these grasses.
The dense bunches also provide cover for small animals such as the rare Botteri's sparrow (Aimophila botterii).
"Lovegrasses may be important groundcover on oceanic islands like Laysan, where other plants are rare."
"Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing."
"From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water."
"The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended."
"In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss."
"This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting.In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal."
"Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers."
The word also refers to the materials used to upholster something.
"Upholstery comes from the Middle English word upholder, which referred to an artisan who makes fabric furnishings."
"The term is equally applicable to domestic, automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design."
A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer.
An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer.
"Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up."
"In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on."
"Jungle Fever is a 1991 American romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee."
"The film stars Wesley Snipes, Annabella Sciorra, Lee, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Lonette McKee, John Turturro, Frank Vincent, Halle Berry (in her film debut), Tim Robbins, Brad Dourif, Queen Latifah, Michael Imperioli, and Anthony Quinn, and is Lee's fifth feature-length film."
Jungle Fever explores the beginning and end of an extramarital interracial relationship against the urban backdrop of the streets of New York City in the early 1990s.
"The film received positive reviews, with particular praise for Samuel L. Jackson's performance."
"The vertical bar, |, is a glyph with various uses in mathematics, computing, and typography."
"It has many names, often related to particular meanings: Sheffer stroke (in logic), pipe, vbar, stick, vertical line, bar, verti-bar, and several variants on these names."
Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs that causes coughing.
"Symptoms include coughing up sputum, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain."
"Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks, and is also known as a chest cold."
In more than 90% of cases the cause is a viral infection.
These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact.
A small number of cases are caused by a bacterial infection such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis.
"Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution."
"Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with the fever.Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough – one that produces sputum – that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years."
Many people with chronic bronchitis also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
"Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role."
"Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids."
Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.Acute bronchitis is one of the more common diseases.
About 5% of adults and 6% of children have at least one episode a year.
Acute bronchitis is the most common type of bronchitis.
"By contrast in the United States, in 2018, 9.3 million people were diagnosed with the less common chronic bronchitis."
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers.
"Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory."
"In these systems, students progress through a series of schools."
The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.
"An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university."
"In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education."
Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).
"University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school."
"A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance."
Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.
"Non-government schools, also known as private schools, may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs."
"Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements."
"Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools."
"Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives, of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others, of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity, and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn.In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively."
"Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school."
"Aspen is a common name for certain tree species; some, but not all, are classified by botanists in the section Populus, of the Populus genus."
"The inventive step and non-obviousness reflect a general patentability requirement present in most patent laws, according to which an invention should be sufficiently inventive—i.e., non-obvious—in order to be patented."
"In other words, ""[the] nonobviousness principle asks whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond or above the state of the art"".The expression ""inventive step"" is predominantly used in Europe, while the expression ""non-obviousness"" is predominantly used in United States patent law."
"The expression ""inventiveness"" is sometimes used as well."
"Although the basic principle is roughly the same, the assessment of the inventive step and non-obviousness varies from one country to another."
"For instance, the practice of the European Patent Office (EPO) differs from the practice in the United Kingdom."
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
"Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals."
"The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth."
"Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts."
Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
"Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture."
"As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography."
"Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes."
"As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems."
"This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.
"The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food."
"The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the ""right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food"", as well as the ""fundamental right to be free from hunger""."
"Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 ""Zero hunger"" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030."
"Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
"There are three cuneiform (""wedge-shaped"") bones in the human foot:

the first or medial cuneiform
the second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform
the third or lateral cuneiformThey are located between the navicular bone and the first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone."
"A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling."
The female counterpart is a sister.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full brother is a first degree relative.
A threat is a communication of intent to inflict harm or loss on another person.
Intimidation is widely observed in animal behavior (particularly in a ritualized form) chiefly in order to avoid the unnecessary physical violence that can lead to physical damage or the death of both conflicting parties.
A threat is considered an act of coercion.
Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against their will.
"In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation."
A brigade is a major tactical military formation  that is typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements.
It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment.
Two or more brigades may constitute a division.
Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades).
"In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units."
"Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups."
"On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task."
"Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic."
Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure.
"The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 3,200 to 5,500 troops."
"However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could go as high as 11,000 troops."
"The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use ""regiment"" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II."
"A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel."
"In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer."
The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff.
"The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff."
Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff.
Some brigades may also have a deputy commander.
"The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade."
"On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached."
The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit.
"In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit."
"In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering."
Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds.
"Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food."
"Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings."
"In common language usage, ""fruit"" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries."
"In botanical usage, the term ""fruit"" also includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains."
"Possession of stolen goods is a crime in which an individual has bought, been given, or acquired stolen goods."
"In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods and the good and or property is returned."
"If the individual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted."
"However, there are often exceptions, because of the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's knowledge that the goods were stolen."
Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.
"It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an acquaintance or an association, such as a classmate, neighbor, or colleague."
"In some cultures, the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; in others, such as the US and Canada, a person could have many friends, plus perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called best friends."
"Friendship has been studied in academic fields, such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy."
"Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles."
"Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many such bonds."
"Such features include choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together, and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another."
"In a religious context, sin is a transgression against divine law."
Each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin.
"While sins are generally considered actions, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed ""sinful""."
Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air.
"Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye."
"Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, dew, or fog to be present."
Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest.
The same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than warm air.
A related parameter is the dew point.
The amount of water vapor needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases.
As the temperature of a parcel of air decreases it will eventually reach the saturation point without adding or losing water mass.
The amount of water vapor contained within a parcel of air can vary significantly.
"For example, a parcel of air near saturation may contain 28 g (0.99 oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 30 °C (86 °F), but only 8 g (0.28 oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 8 °C (46 °F)."
"Three primary measurements of humidity are widely employed: absolute, relative, and specific."
Absolute humidity is expressed as either mass of water vapor per volume of moist air (in grams per cubic metre) or as mass of water vapor per mass of dry air (usually in grams per kilogram).
"Relative humidity, often expressed as a percentage, indicates a present state of absolute humidity relative to a maximum humidity given the same temperature."
Specific humidity is the ratio of water vapor mass to total moist air parcel mass.
Humidity plays an important role for surface life.
"For animal life dependent on perspiration (sweating) to regulate internal body temperature, high humidity impairs heat exchange efficiency by reducing the rate of moisture evaporation from skin surfaces."
"This effect can be calculated using a heat index table, also known as a humidex."
"The notion of air ""holding"" water vapor or being ""saturated"" by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity."
"This, however, is misleading—the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is almost independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.)"
that is present.
"Indeed, a vacuum has approximately the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature."
"There is a very small difference described under ""Enhancement factor"" below, which can be neglected in many calculations unless high accuracy is required."
"The green iguana (Iguana iguana), also known as the American iguana or the common green iguana, is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana."
"Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana."
"The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area; it is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico, and has been introduced from South America to Puerto Rico and is very common throughout the island, where it is colloquially known as gallina de palo (""bamboo chicken"" or ""chicken of the trees"") and considered an invasive species; in the United States, feral populations also exist in South Florida (including the Florida Keys), Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas."
"Green iguanas have also successfully colonised the island of Anguilla, arriving on the island in 1995 after rafting across the Caribbean from Guadeloupe, where they were introduced."
"A herbivore, it has adapted significantly with regard to locomotion and osmoregulation as a result of its diet."
"It grows to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than 2 m (6.6 ft) with bodyweights upward of 20 lb (9.1 kg)."
"Commonly found in captivity as a pet due to its calm disposition and bright colors, it can be very demanding to care for properly."
Space requirements and the need for special lighting and heat can prove challenging to the hobbyist.
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
"Calochortus elegans is a species of flowering plant in the lily family known by the common name elegant Mariposa lily, cat's ear, elegant cat's ears or star tulip."
"It is native to the western United States from northern California to Montana.It is a perennial herb producing a slender, generally unbranched stem up to 15 centimeters in height."
The basal leaf is 10 to 20 centimeters long and does not wither at flowering.
The inflorescence bears 1 to 7 erect bell-shaped flowers.
Each flower has three sepals and three petals with very hairy inner surfaces and edges.
Each petal is greenish white in color with a purple crescent above a hairless patch at the base.
"The fruit is a winged capsule about 2 centimeters long.The bulb is a choice wild root vegetable when eaten cooked, and can be eaten raw to avoid starvation."

Facets () are flat faces on geometric shapes.
"The organization of naturally occurring facets was key to early developments in crystallography, since they reflect the underlying symmetry of the crystal structure."
Gemstones commonly have facets cut into them in order to improve their appearance by allowing them to reflect light.
"Myriopteris lanosa, the hairy lip fern, is a moderately-sized fern of the eastern United States, a member of the family Pteridaceae."
"Its leaves and stem are sparsely covered in hairs, but lack scales, hence its common name."
"One of the cheilanthoid ferns, it was usually classified in the genus Cheilanthes until 2013, when the genus Myriopteris was again recognized as separate from Cheilanthes."
"It typically grows in shallow, dry, soil, often in rocky habitats."
"A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations."
Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members.
"In the social sciences, a larger society often exhibits stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups."
Societies construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts as acceptable or unacceptable.
These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as societal norms.
"Societies, and their norms, undergo gradual and perpetual changes."
"Insofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap."
"A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society."
"This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology, and also applied to distinctive subsections of a larger society."
"More broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals."
"In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than ""other people"" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment."
A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles and techniques to communicate ideas.
"Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the general public."
Writers' texts are published across a wide range of media.
"Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term ""writer"" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but as a standalone ""writer"" normally refers to the creation of written language."
Some writers work from an oral tradition.
"Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional."
"Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas."
"Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind."
"Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing."
"In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on how they write (that is, the process they use); why they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism)."
"Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published."
Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.
"The term writer is often used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative."
Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences.
"A variety of complex neurobiological and psychosocial factors are implicated in the development of addiction, with the predominant paradigm among researchers in the United States being the Brain Disease model, though debate exists within the field over relative contribution of any given factor."
"Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences."
"Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, marijuana addiction, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opioid addiction, food addiction, chocolate addiction, video game addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction."
The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 and the ICD-10 is gambling addiction.
With the introduction of the ICD-11 gaming addiction was appended.
"The term ""addiction"" is frequently misused when referring to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media."
"An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use."
Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal.
"Addiction can occur in the absence of dependence, and dependence can occur in the absence of addiction, although the two often occur together."
"Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development."
"Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research."
"Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves."
"Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational."
The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
"Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship."
"In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age."
"There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies."
A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.
"Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all."
Existence is the ability of an entity to interact with physical reality.
"In philosophy, it refers to the ontological property of being."
"The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)."
"The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT)."
The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems.
"The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine."
"The existence of the NSA was not revealed until 1975.Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952."
"Between then and the end of the Cold War, it became the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget, but information available as of 2013 indicates that the CIA pulled ahead in this regard, with a budget of $14.7 billion."
The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end.
"The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program."
"The NSA, alongside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies)."
"SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass ""close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering"".Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering."
"The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own."
"As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense cryptanalysis components."
"To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service."
"The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including its spying on anti–Vietnam War leaders and the agency's participation in economic espionage."
"In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor."
"According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens."
The documents also revealed the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people's movements using cellphones' metadata.
"Internationally, research has pointed to the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through ""boomerang routing""."
An actor or actress (see below) is a person who portrays a character in a performance.
"The actor performs ""in the flesh"" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television."
"The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally ""one who answers""."
"The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character."
"This can also be considered an ""actor's role,"" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters."
"Interpretation occurs even when the actor is ""playing themselves"", as in some forms of experimental performance art."
"Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys."
"While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts."
"The commedia dell’arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe)."
"After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England."
"In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men."
"A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors."
"While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities."
A playground might exclude children below a certain age.
"Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development."
Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.
"Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball."
"Public playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use."
A type of playground called a playscape is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.

Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of particles in matter.
Thermal radiation is generated when heat from the movement of charges in the material (electrons and protons in common forms of matter) is converted to electromagnetic radiation.
All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation.
Particle motion results in charge-acceleration or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation.
Infrared radiation emitted by animals (detectable with an infrared camera) and cosmic microwave background radiation are examples of thermal radiation.
"If a radiation object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation is called blackbody radiation."
"Planck's law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation, which depends solely on the object's temperature."
"Wien's displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity.Thermal radiation is also one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer."
A bracelet is an article of jewellery that is worn around the wrist.
"Bracelets may serve different uses, such as being worn as an ornament."
"When worn as ornaments, bracelets may have a supportive function to hold other items of decoration, such as charms."
"Medical and identity information are marked on some bracelets, such as allergy bracelets, hospital patient-identification tags, and bracelet tags for newborn babies."
"Bracelets may be worn to signify a certain phenomenon, such as breast cancer awareness, or for religious/cultural purposes."
"If a bracelet is a single, inflexible loop, it is often called a bangle."
When it is worn around the ankle it is called an ankle bracelet or anklet.
A boot bracelet is used to decorate boots.
"Bracelets can be manufactured from metal, leather, cloth, plastic, bead or other materials, and jewelry bracelets sometimes contain jewels, rocks, wood, shells, crystals, metal, or plastic hoops, pearls and many more materials."
The Beachy Amish Mennonites are an Anabaptist group of churches with Amish roots.
"Although they have retained the name ""Amish"" they are quite different from the common idea of Amish: they do not use horse and buggy for transportation, with a few exceptions they do not speak Pennsylvania German anymore, nor do they have restrictions on technology except for radio and television."
In the years 1946 to 1977 a majority was transformed into an evangelical revivalist denomination.
The traditionalists who wanted to preserve the old Beachy Amish ways then withdrew and formed their own congregations.
"Today they are known as Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonites or Old Beachy Amish.They form a loose association of churches without a central governing body; therefore, few common characteristics are shared by all Beachy congregations."
"Some similarities include adhering to the Dordrecht Confession of Faith and practicing varying degrees of Anabaptist practice, such as nonresistance, separation from the state, and adult baptism."
"Bull pine is a common name for several species of North American “yellow pine” trees — Genus Pinus, Section Trifoliae (“American hard pines”) — especially large, or unusually large and isolated, specimens of the following."
"Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)
Slash pine (Pinus elliottii)
Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi)
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
Gray pine (Pinus sabiniana)
Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)"
"Cyrus II of Persia (c. 600–530 BC; Old Persian: 𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁, romanized: Kūruš), commonly known as Cyrus the Great and also called Cyrus the Elder by the Greeks, was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, the first Persian empire."
"Under his rule, the empire embraced all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia."
"Spanning from the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, the empire created by Cyrus was the largest the world had yet seen."
"At its maximum extent under his successors, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from parts of the Balkans (Eastern Bulgaria–Paeonia and Thrace–Macedonia) and Southeast Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east."
The reign of Cyrus lasted about thirty years; his empire took root with his conquest of the Median Empire followed by the Lydian Empire and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire.
"He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought ""into subjection every nation without exception""."
"Cyrus did not venture into Egypt, and was alleged to have died in battle while fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC."
"However, Xenophon claimed that Cyrus did not die in battle and returned to the Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis again."
"He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses II, who managed to conquer Egypt, Nubia and Cyrenaica during his short rule."
Cyrus is well-known for having respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered.
"He was important in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae governing satraps in the empire's border regions, which worked very effectively and profitably for both rulers and subjects."
"The Edict of Restoration, a proclamation attested by a cylinder seal in which Cyrus authorized and encouraged the return of the Israelites to the Land of Israel following his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, is described in the Bible and likewise left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion due to his role in ending the Babylonian captivity and facilitating the Jewish return to Zion."
"According to Isaiah 45:1 of the Hebrew Bible, God anointed Cyrus for this task, even referring to him as a messiah (lit."
"'anointed one'); Cyrus is the only non-Jewish figure in the Bible to be revered in this capacity.Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations."
"The Achaemenid influence in the ancient world would eventually extend as far as Athens, where upper-class Athenians adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling class of Achaemenid Persia as their own."
"Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern-day Fars Province of Iran, Cyrus has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern Iran."
"He remains a cult figure amongst modern Iranians, with his tomb serving as a spot of reverence for millions of people."
"In the 1970s, the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, identified Cyrus' famous proclamation inscribed onto the Cyrus Cylinder as the oldest-known declaration of human rights, and the Cylinder has since been popularized as such."
This view has been criticized by some Western historians as a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a traditional statement that new monarchs make at the beginning of their reign.
"Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia."
All living amphibians belong to the group Lissamphibia.
"They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems."
"Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this."
The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs.
Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin.
"They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed."
"With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe."
"The earliest amphibians (""crown"") evolved in the Carboniferous period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land."
"They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates."
"Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia."
"The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura (the frogs), Urodela (the salamanders), and Apoda (the caecilians)."
"The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs."
The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just 7.7 mm (0.30 in).
"The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m (30 ft) Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil."
"The study of amphibians is called batrachology, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology."
Straw is an agricultural byproduct consisting of the dry stalks of cereal plants after the grain and chaff have been removed.
"It makes up about half of the yield of cereal crops such as barley, oats, rice, rye and wheat."
"It has a number of different uses, including fuel, livestock bedding and fodder, thatching and basket making."
"Straw is usually gathered and stored in a straw bale, which is a bale, or bundle, of straw tightly bound with twine, wire, or string."
"Straw bales may be square, rectangular, or round, and can be very large, depending on the type of baler used."
"Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)."
"Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit."
"Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail."
"The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet."
"With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration."
"Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors."
A language is a structured system of communication used by humans.
"Languages can be based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or writing."
The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary.
"Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation."
"Human language is unique among the known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound, etc."
"), is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems.Human languages have the properties of productivity and displacement, and rely on social convention and learning."
"Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000."
Precise estimates depend on an arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) being established between languages and dialects.
"Natural languages are spoken, signed, or both; however, any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, writing, whistling, signing, or braille."
"In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures."
"Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, ""language"" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules."
All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings.
"Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances."
The scientific study of language is called linguistics.
"Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc., such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization."
"Thinkers such as Rousseau (1712 – 1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like Kant (1724 –1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought."
Twentieth century philosophers such as Wittgenstein (1889 – 1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself.
Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.
Language is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality.
"This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions."
"Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas."
"Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old."
Language and culture are codependent.
"Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment."
"Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur."
"A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate."
"There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all."
Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.
"Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Karram al-Sijistani (Arabic: أبو عبد الله محمد بن كَرَّام السجستاني) was an ascetic, hellfire preacher, hadith narrator, and a literalist theologian who founded the Karramiyya sect."
"His views were considered heretical, schismatic, and abominable by the majority of Sunni scholars."
"He was accused of holding the doctrine of anthropomorphism, and that his chief theological doctrine was that God is a substance (jawhar) and that he had a body (jism); for which reason his followers were commonly called the ""Mujassima"" (corporealists) and ""Mushabbiha"" (anthropomorphists)."
"Some sources reported that he was of Arab descent, and his lineage belongs to the Bani Nizar, or Bani Turab (the people or sons of Turab), and according to some, to the Arab tribe of the Banu Nadhir."
It has been said that the sultan Mahmud al-Ghaznawi (d. 1030) was one of his followers.
"A tea cosy  or tea warmer is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth."
"It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm."
Their use predates the invention of vacuum flasks as a means of keeping hot liquids hot.
Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed.
"Some tea cosies are hand-knitted, resembling woollen hats, some even feature a ""bobble""  (pom-pom) on top, which may also serve as a handle to remove or lift the tea cosy."
"Sometimes, if the tea is served in a restaurant or in a hotel, the teapot is covered with a tea cosy that has a metal exterior to protect the inner fabric of the cosy from wear and tear and also to further improve the insulation of the teapot."
"A special tea cosy is the so-called tea lugger, which enables the hot teapot to be carried around easily."
"Tea cosies may sometimes be made in matching sets with items such as tablecloths, oven gloves, or aprons."
"Cloth tea-cosies may be embroidered, perhaps to complement a fine set of china."
"Some have been made with hidden pockets to be filled with fragrant herbs or flowers, similar to a potpourri."
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
"For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself."
"However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4."
Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.
The property of being prime is called primality.
"A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , called trial division, tests whether 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a multiple of any integer between 2 and 
  
    
      
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}
  ."
"Faster algorithms include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical."
"Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers."
"As of December 2018 the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 decimal digits.There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC."
No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers.
"However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled."
"The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm."
Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved.
"These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them."
"Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers."
"Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors."
"In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals."
"A carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that promotes carcinogenesis, the formation of cancer."
This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.
"Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example gamma rays and alpha particles, which they emit."
"Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke."
"Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances."
"Carcinogens are not necessarily immediately toxic; thus, their effect can be insidious."
Cancer is any disease in which normal cells are damaged and do not undergo programmed cell death as fast as they divide via mitosis.
"Carcinogens may increase the risk of cancer by altering cellular metabolism or damaging DNA directly in cells, which interferes with biological processes, and induces the uncontrolled, malignant division, ultimately leading to the formation of tumors."
"Usually, severe DNA damage leads to programmed cell death, but if the programmed cell death pathway is damaged, then the cell cannot prevent itself from becoming a cancer cell."
There are many natural carcinogens.
"Aflatoxin B1, which is produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus growing on stored grains, nuts and peanut butter, is an example of a potent, naturally occurring microbial carcinogen."
Certain viruses such as hepatitis B and human papilloma virus have been found to cause cancer in humans.
"The first one shown to cause cancer in animals is Rous sarcoma virus, discovered in 1910 by Peyton Rous."
Other infectious organisms which cause cancer in humans include some bacteria (e.g.
Helicobacter pylori ) and helminths (e.g.
Opisthorchis viverrini  and Clonorchis sinensis).
"Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, benzene, kepone, EDB, and asbestos have all been classified as carcinogenic."
"As far back as the 1930s, Industrial smoke and tobacco smoke were identified as sources of dozens of carcinogens, including benzo[a]pyrene, tobacco-specific nitrosamines such as nitrosonornicotine, and reactive aldehydes such as formaldehyde, which is also a hazard in embalming and making plastics."
"Vinyl chloride, from which PVC is manufactured, is a carcinogen and thus a hazard in PVC production."
"Co-carcinogens are chemicals that do not necessarily cause cancer on their own, but promote the activity of other carcinogens in causing cancer."
"After the carcinogen enters the body, the body makes an attempt to eliminate it through a process called biotransformation."
The purpose of these reactions is to make the carcinogen more water-soluble so that it can be removed from the body.
"However, in some cases, these reactions can also convert a less toxic carcinogen into a more toxic carcinogen."
"DNA is nucleophilic; therefore, soluble carbon electrophiles are carcinogenic, because DNA attacks them."
"For example, some alkenes are toxicated by human enzymes to produce an electrophilic epoxide."
"DNA attacks the epoxide, and is bound permanently to it."
"This is the mechanism behind the carcinogenicity of benzo[a]pyrene in tobacco smoke, other aromatics, aflatoxin and mustard gas."
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"A sail is a tensile structure—made from fabric or other membrane materials—that uses wind power to propel sailing craft, including sailing ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles."
"Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials—including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments—usually in a three- or four-sided shape."
"A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack—its angle with respect to the apparent wind."
Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft.
Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail.
"On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the  sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface—just as an airplane wing generates lift—which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion."
"The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces."
Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind.
"Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast."
"They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet."
"In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges."
Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points.
"Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
"Torbjørn Rødland (born 1970) is a Norwegian photographic artist, whose images are saturated with symbolism, lyricism, and eroticism."
His 2017 Serpentine Gallery solo exhibition was titled The Touch That Made You and travelled to the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2018.
His work was shown at the Venice Biennale of 1999.
"An early retrospective was held at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo in 2003.Among public collections holding examples of his work are the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Fonds national d'art contemporain in Paris, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and Moderna Museet in Stockholm."
"Marriage law refers to the legal requirements that determine the validity of a marriage, and which vary considerably among countries."
See also Marriage Act.
"A muffin top (also muffin-top) is a slang term typically used to describe a person's body fat that extends horizontally over the edges of the waistline of tightly fitting pants or skirts, visible when there is a gap between the upper and lower garment."
"The term is a reference to the way a muffin appears when it has been baked in a muffin tin, so that the top of the muffin extends horizontally over and around the top of the tin or casing."
"A law enforcement agency (LEA), in American English, is any government agency responsible for the enforcement of the laws."
"Outside the United States, such organizations are usually called police services."
"In North America, some of these services are called police, others are known as sheriff's offices/departments, while U.S. investigative police services are often called bureaus, for example the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
"Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons."
"With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City."
"The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television."
"The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane."
Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993.
"They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC."
"After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California."
The entire series ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season.
"The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time."
"The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season."
The show ranked no.

The voltaic pile was the first electrical battery that could continuously provide an electric current to a circuit.
"It was invented by Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, who published his experiments in 1799."
"The voltaic pile then enabled a rapid series of other discoveries including the electrical decomposition (electrolysis) of water into oxygen and hydrogen by William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle (1800) and the discovery or isolation of the chemical elements sodium (1807), potassium (1807), calcium (1808), boron (1808), barium (1808), strontium (1808), and magnesium (1808) by Humphry Davy.The entire 19th-century electrical industry was powered by batteries related to Volta's (e.g."
the Daniell cell and Grove cell) until the advent of the dynamo (the electrical generator) in the 1870s.
Volta's invention was built on Luigi Galvani's 1780s discovery of how a circuit of two metals and a frog's leg can cause the frog's leg to respond.
Volta demonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and brine-soaked cloth or cardboard are arranged in a circuit they produce an electric current.
"In 1800, Volta stacked several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs (electrodes) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in brine (electrolyte) to increase the total electromotive force."
"When the top and bottom contacts were connected by a wire, an electric current flowed through the voltaic pile and the connecting wire."
A pocket is a bag- or envelope-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing to hold small items.
"Pockets are also  attached to luggage, backpacks, and similar items."
"In older usage, a pocket was a separate small bag or pouch."
A planet is a large astronomical body that is not a star or stellar remnant.
There are competing scientific definitions of a 'planet'.
"In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects."
"The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition."
"In the geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite."
"In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology and religion."
"Apart from the Moon, five planets are visible to the naked eye in the night sky."
Planets were regarded by many early cultures as emissaries of deities or as divine themselves.
"As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, and the invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of additional planetary objects that were diverse in size, shape and orbit."
"In 2006, the IAU adopted a resolution limiting the number of planets within the Solar System, though they are not followed by all astronomers, especially planetologists."
The IAU resolution is controversial because it excludes many geologically active objects of planetary mass due to where or what they orbit.
Ptolemy thought that the planets orbited Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
"Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested before, it wasn't until the 17th century that this view was supported by the concrete evidence, in the form of telescopic observations performed by Galileo Galilei."
"About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular."
"As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and that some shared such features as ice caps and seasons."
"Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observations by space probes have found that Earth and other planets share additional characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology."
The eight Solar planets in the IAU definition are divided into two divergent types: large low-density giant planets and small rocky terrestrial planets.
"In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the four giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."
"Six are orbited by natural satellites, the two exceptions being the innermost planets Mercury and Venus."
"Under geophysical definitions, the classification is more complex: the Moon and Jupiter's moons Io and Europa are additional terrestrial planets, but a large number of small icy planets are also added, such as the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto and the other large giant-planet moons such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan."
"Beginning at the end of the twentieth century, several thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars."
"These are referred to as ""extrasolar planets"", or ""exoplanets"" for short."
"As of 1 January 2022, 4,905 extrasolar planets have been discovered in 3,629 planetary systems."
The count includes 808 multi-planetary systems.
Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon.
"More than 100 of these planets are approximately the size as Earth, nine of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star."
"In 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f."
"A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates a minimum of 1.6 bound planets on average for every star in the Milky Way."
"As of 2013, one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone."
A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.
The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.
"Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky."
"The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names."
Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.
"The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way."
"A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements."
The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.
"For most of its active life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space."
"At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole."
Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than lithium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants.
Chemically enriched material is returned to the interstellar medium by stellar mass loss or supernova explosions and then recycled into new stars.
"Astronomers can determine stellar properties including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position on the sky over time."
"Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars."
"When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution."
"Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy."
"A Wild Sheep Chase (羊をめぐる冒険, Hitsuji o meguru bōken) (literally An Adventure Surrounding Sheep) is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami."
"First published in Japan in 1982, it was translated into English in 1989."
"It is an independent sequel to Pinball, 1973, and the third book in the so-called ""Trilogy of the Rat""."
It won the 1982 Noma Literary Newcomer's Prize.
"While the original story of A Wild Sheep Chase was set in the 1970s, translator Alfred Birnbaum and Kodansha editor Elmer Luke wanted a story that was more contemporary and also appealed to American readers."
"In the novel, Murakami blends elements of American and English literature with Japanese contexts, exploring post-WWII Japanese cultural identity."
The book is part mystery and part magical realism with a postmodern twist.
"A Wild Sheep Chase has been defined as a parody or a renewal of Yukio Mishima's Natsuko no Bōken (夏子の冒険, Natsuko's Adventure)."
The Great Imitator (also the Great Masquerader) is a phrase used for medical conditions that feature nonspecific symptoms and may be confused with a number of other diseases.
"The term connotes especially difficult differential diagnosis, especial potential for misdiagnosis, and the protean nature of some diseases."
Most great imitators are systemic in nature.
"Diseases sometimes referred to with this name include:

Various cancersIntravascular large B-cell lymphoma
Mycosis fungoides
Beriberi
Various rheumatic conditions, including:
Fibromyalgia
Psoriatic arthritis
Lupus erythematosusSystemic lupus erythematosus
Sarcoidosis
Multiple sclerosis
Celiac disease
Addison's disease
Pulmonary embolism
Various infectious diseases, including:
Syphilis
Lyme disease
Nocardiosis
Tuberculosis
Brucellosis
Infective endocarditis
Malaria
Breathing-related sleep disorders (chiefly sleep apnea/hypopnea and upper-airway resistance syndrome)
Hypoglycemia as an imitator of a stroke
Amyloidosis
Pheochromocytoma
Various abdominal conditions:
Appendicitis
Pancreatitis"
"Private equity (PE) typically refers to investment funds, generally organized as limited partnerships, that buy and restructure companies."
"More formally, private equity is a type of equity and one of the asset classes consisting of equity securities and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange.A private-equity investment will generally be made by a private-equity firm, a venture capital firm or an angel investor."
"Each of these categories of investors has its own set of goals, preferences and investment strategies; however, all provide working capital to a target company to nurture expansion, new-product development, or restructuring of the company's operations, management, or ownership.Common investment strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital."
"In a typical leveraged-buyout transaction, a private-equity firm buys majority control of an existing or mature firm."
"This is distinct from a venture-capital or growth-capital investment, in which the investors (typically venture-capital firms or angel investors) invest in young, growing or emerging companies,  but rarely obtain majority control."
"Private equity is also often grouped into a broader category called ""private capital"", generally used to describe capital supporting any long-term, illiquid investment strategy.Bloomberg Businessweek has called ""private equity"" a rebranding of leveraged-buyout firms after the 1980s.To compensate for private equities not being traded on the public market, a private equity secondary market has formed, where private equity investors purchase securities and assets from other private equity investors."
Mass is the quantity of matter in a physical body.
"It is also a measure of the body's inertia, the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied."
An object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).
"In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses."
"An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass."
"This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force."
"A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or lunchroom (in American English)."
"Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from Latin American Spanish, where it had and still has the meaning ""coffeehouse""."
"Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths."
"Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray."
"In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly  items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting."
"Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table."
"For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out."
Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system.
"For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States."
Customers are either charged a flat rate for admission (as in a buffet) or pay at the check-out for each item.
Some self-service cafeterias charge by the weight of items on a patron's plate.
"In universities and colleges, some students pay for three meals a day by making a single large payment for the entire semester."
"As cafeterias require few employees, they are often found within a larger institution, catering to the clientele of that institution."
"For example, schools, colleges and their residence halls, department stores, hospitals, museums, places of worship, amusement parks, military bases, prisons, factories and office buildings often have cafeterias."
"Although some of such institutions self-operate their cafeterias, many outsource their cafeterias to a food service management company or lease space to independent businesses to operate food service facilities."
"The three largest food service management companies servicing institutions are Aramark, Compass Group, and Sodexo.At one time, upscale cafeteria-style restaurants dominated the culture of the Southern United States, and to a lesser extent the Midwest."
"There were numerous prominent chains of them: Bickford's, Morrison's Cafeteria, Piccadilly Cafeteria, S&W Cafeteria, Apple House, Luby's, K&W, Britling, Wyatt's Cafeteria and Blue Boar among them."
"Currently, two Midwestern chains still exist, Sloppy Jo's Lunchroom and Manny's, which are both located in Illinois."
"There were also a number of smaller chains, usually located in and around a single city."
"These institutions, with the exception of K&W, went into a decline in the 1960s with the rise of fast food and were largely finished off in the 1980s by the rise of all-you-can-eat buffets and other casual dining establishments."
A few chains—particularly Luby's and Piccadilly Cafeterias (which took over the Morrison's chain in 1998)—continue to fill some of the gap left by the decline of the older chains.
"Some of the smaller Midwestern chains, such as MCL Cafeterias centered on Indianapolis, are still very much in business."
The sky is the panorama obtained from observing the universe from the Earth and other celestial bodies' surface.
"In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere."
"This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting."
The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
"Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary."
"An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night."
"In some cases, such as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere."
The daytime sky appears blue because air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than longer ones (redder light).
The night sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars.
The Sun and sometimes the Moon are visible in the daytime sky unless obscured by clouds.
"At night, the Moon, planets, and stars are similarly visible in the sky."
"Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae."
Lightning and precipitation are also visible in the sky.
"Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites, can fly in the sky."
"Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities."
"A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and/or squalls."
"Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane (), typhoon (), tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply cyclone."
"A hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean or northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; in the Indian Ocean, south Pacific, or (rarely) South Atlantic, comparable storms are referred to simply as ""tropical cyclones"", and such storms in the Indian Ocean can also be called ""severe cyclonic storms""."
"""Tropical"" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas."
"""Cyclone"" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere."
The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect.
Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water.
"They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately condenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation."
"This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters and European windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts."
"Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (60 and 1,240 mi) in diameter."
"Every year tropical cyclones impact various regions of the globe including the Gulf Coast of North America, Australia, India and Bangladesh."
The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation.
"As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator."
Tropical cyclones are very rare in the South Atlantic (although occasional examples do occur) due to consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone.
"Conversely, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability give rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, while cyclones near Australia owe their genesis to the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool."
The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters.
"These storms are therefore typically strongest when over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land."
"This causes coastal regions to be particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, compared to inland regions."
"Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), storm surges (due to wind and severe pressure changes), and the potential of spawning tornadoes."
Tropical cyclones draw in air from a large area and concentrate the water content of that air (from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into precipitation over a much smaller area.
"This replenishing of moisture-bearing air after rain may cause multi-hour or multi-day extremely heavy rain up to 40 kilometers (25 mi) from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time."
"This in turn can lead to river flooding, overland flooding, and a general overwhelming of local water control structures across a large area."
"Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones may play a role in relieving drought conditions, though this claim is disputed."
"They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it towards temperate latitudes, which plays an important role in regulating global climate."
"A phonograph disc record (also known as a gramophone disc record, especially in British English), or simply a phonograph record, gramophone record, disc record, long-playing record, or record, is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove."
The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc.
"At first, the discs were commonly made from shellac, with earlier records having a fine abrasive filler mixed in."
"Starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common, hence the name ""vinyl""."
"In the mid-2000s, gradually, records made of any material began to be called vinyl disc records, also known as vinyl records or vinyl for short."
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century.
It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912.
Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed.
"By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991."
"Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres."
They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles.
"The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence as a format for rock music in the early 21st century—9.2 million records were sold in the US in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009."
"Likewise, sales in the UK increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.As of 2017, 48 record pressing facilities remain worldwide, 18 in the US and 30 in other countries."
The increased popularity of the record has led to the investment in new and modern record-pressing machines.
"Only two producers of lacquers (acetate discs or master discs) remain: Apollo Masters in California, and MDC in Japan."
"On February 6, 2020, a fire destroyed the Apollo Masters plant."
"According to the Apollo Masters website, their future is still uncertain.Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch) (although they were designed in millimeters), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (8+1⁄3, 16+2⁄3, 33+1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long playing], 12-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 rpm; SP [single], 10-inch disc, 78 rpm, or 7-inch disc, 45 rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 or 45 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc."
"); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.)."
"The phrase broken record refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.The large cover (and inner sleeves) are valued by collectors and artists for the space given for visual expression, especially in the case of 12-inch discs."
"KFC (also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken) is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky that specializes in fried chicken."
"It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019."
The chain is a subsidiary of Yum!
"Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and WingStreet chains.KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression."
"Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" franchise opened in Utah in 1952."
"KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger."
"By branding himself as ""Colonel Sanders"", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day."
"However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y."
Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.
"KFC was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s."
"Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business."
"In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo."
"The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987 it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China."
"It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market."
"PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum!"
Brands.
"KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices."
The constituents of the recipe are a trade secret.
"Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard ""bucket"", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957."
"Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo."
"KFC is known for its slogans ""It's Finger Lickin' Good!"
""", ""Nobody does chicken like KFC"" and ""So good""."
Conversation is interactive communication between two or more people.
The development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization.
The development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of language teaching and learning.
"Conversation analysis is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction, with a more specific focus on conversational interaction."
An office is a space where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization.
"The word ""office"" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty."
"When used as an adjective, the term ""office"" may refer to business-related tasks."
"In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair."
"An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company."
In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.
"According to James Stephenson, ""Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities."""
Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple.
"The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery, which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom."
"With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed."
"As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities."
"The time-and-motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor (1856-1915) led to the ""Modern Efficiency Desk"" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers."
"However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, and gradually the cubicle system evolved.The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs."
"Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work."
"There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities."
"In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms, lounges, and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing."
Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches.
"There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important."
"While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security."
The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers.
"These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas."
The chief operating officer (COO) is responsible for handling administration and maintenance of an office building.
"A swimsuit is an item of clothing designed to be worn by people engaging in a water-based activity or water sports, such as swimming, diving and surfing, or sun-orientated activities, such as sun bathing."
"Different types may be worn by men, women, and children."
"A swimsuit can be described by various names, some of which are used only in particular locations, including swimwear, bathing suit, swimming costume, bathing costume, swimming suit, swimmers, swimming togs, bathers, cossie (short for ""costume""), or swimming trunks for men, besides others."
"A swimsuit can be worn as an undergarment in sports that require a wetsuit such as water skiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding."
"Swimsuits may also be worn to display the wearer's physical attributes, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests, and glamour photography and magazines like the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue featuring models and sports personalities in swimsuits."
"There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits available, which vary as to body coverage and materials."
"The choice of style may depend on community standards of modesty, as well as current fashions, and personal preferences."
"The choice will also consider the occasion, for example whether it is to be worn for a passive occasion such as sunbathing or for an activity such as surfing or swimsuit competition."
Swimwear universally cover at least the wearer′s crotch area.
"For males, swimwear today usually exposes the chest, while swimsuits for females usually cover at least the nipples, except in the case of a topless swimsuit."
"A child prodigy is defined in psychology research literature as a person who has not reached the age of puberty, who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert."
"The term is also applied more broadly to young persons who are extraordinarily talented in some field.The term Wunderkind (from German Wunderkind; literally ""wonder child"") is sometimes used as a synonym for child prodigy, particularly in media accounts."
Wunderkind also is used to recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers.
Size in general is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing.
"More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume."
"Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range."
"In mathematical terms, ""size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter""."
"Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement."
"Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches."
"The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight."
"These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes."
"The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid."
A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action.
"The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines."
"Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement."
"They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems."
"Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use."
"Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots."
"Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., Stools, Chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds, and hammocks)."
"Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers)."
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.
"In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose."
"It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood."
Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.
"People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites."
"Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones."
"Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne."
"The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone."
Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt.
"This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory."
"The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping."
"The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented."
Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century.
"The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs."
The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles.
The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism.
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.
"Oatmeal refers, to a preparation of oats that have been dehusked, steamed and flattened, or else a coarse, flour made of hulled oat grains (groats) that have either been milled (ground) or steel-cut."
"Ground oats are also called ""white oats""."
"Steel-cut oats are known as ""coarse oatmeal"", ""Irish oatmeal"" or ""pinhead oats""."
"Rolled oats were traditionally thick ""old-fashioned oats"", but can be made thinner or smaller, and may be categorized as ""quick"" or ""instant"", depending on the cooking time, which is shortened by the size of the oats and precooking."
"The term oatmeal is used to describe a common oat porridge made from ground, steel-cut, or rolled oats."
"Some commercial packages display other ingredients, such as sugar, salt, flavorings, thickeners, vitamins or minerals, while highlighting quick (""instant"") cooking and separately packaged individual portions for convenience."
Pelicans (genus Pelecanus) are a genus of large water birds that make up the family Pelecanidae.
They are characterized by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing.
"They have predominantly pale plumage, except for the brown and Peruvian pelicans."
"The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all pelicans become brightly coloured before the breeding season."
"The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America and from polar regions and the open ocean."
"Long thought to be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, and gannets and boobies, pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes."
"Ibises, spoonbills, herons, and bitterns have been classified in the same order."
Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France.
They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.
"Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface."
"They are gregarious birds, travelling in flocks, hunting cooperatively, and breeding colonially."
"Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees."
The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious.
The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing.
"Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction, disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern."
"They also have a long history of cultural significance in mythology, and in Christian and heraldic iconography."
Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment.
"While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations."
"The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene."
"In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young."
"Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions."
"Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases."
"They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other."
"Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely."
"Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land."
"Many species are currently threatened by human activities, such as from oil spills, getting trapped in nets, and by climate change and severe weather."
Conservation efforts include the establishment of wildlife refugees and adjustments to fishing techniques.
"Trousers (British English), slacks, or pants are an item of clothing that might have originated in Central Asia, worn from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in robes, skirts, and dresses)."
"In the United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers."
"Shorts are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending on the style of the garment."
"To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called ""long trousers"" in certain contexts such as school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called ""short trousers"" in the UK."
"The oldest known trousers were found at the Yanghai cemetery in Turpan, Sinkiang (Tocharia), in present-day western China, it's been dated to the period between the 10th and the 13th centuries BC."
"Made of wool, the trousers had straight legs and wide crotches and were likely made for horseback riding.In most of Europe, trousers have been worn since ancient times and throughout the Medieval period, becoming the most common form of lower-body clothing for adult males in the modern world."
Breeches were worn instead of trousers in early modern Europe by some men in higher classes of society.
Distinctive formal trousers are traditionally worn with formal and semi-formal day attire.
"Since the mid-20th century, trousers have increasingly been worn by women as well."
"Jeans, made of denim, are a form of trousers for casual wear widely worn all over the world by both sexes."
Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports and also often by children and adolescents.
"Trousers are worn on the hips or waist and are often held up by buttons, elastic, a belt or suspenders (braces)."
"Unless elastic, and especially for men, trousers usually provide a zippered or buttoned fly."
Jeans usually feature side and rear pockets with pocket openings placed slightly below the waist band.
It is also possible for trousers to provide cargo pockets further down the legs.
Maintenance of fit is more challenging for trousers than for some other garments.
"Leg-length can be adjusted with a hem, which helps to retain fit during the adolescent and early adulthood growth years."
"Tailoring adjustment of girth to accommodate weight gain or weight loss is relatively limited, and otherwise serviceable trousers may need to be replaced after a significant change in body composition."
"Higher quality trousers often have extra fabric included in the centre-back seam allowance, so the waist can be let out further."
"In international relations, aid (also known as international aid, overseas aid, foreign aid, economic aid or foreign assistance) is – from the perspective of governments – a voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another."
"Aid may serve one or more functions: it may be given as a signal of diplomatic approval, or to strengthen a military ally, to reward a government for behavior desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide infrastructure needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of commercial access."
Countries may provide aid for further diplomatic reasons.
"Humanitarian and altruistic purposes are often reasons for foreign assistance.Aid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments."
"Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered ""aid"" vary from country to country."
"For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958."
"The most widely used measure of aid is ""Official Development Assistance"" (ODA)."
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD; also magneto-fluid dynamics or hydro­magnetics) is the study of the magnetic properties and behaviour of electrically conducting fluids.
"Examples of such magneto­fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, salt water, and electrolytes."
"The word ""magneto­hydro­dynamics"" is derived from magneto- meaning magnetic field, hydro- meaning water, and dynamics meaning movement."
"The field of MHD was initiated by Hannes Alfvén, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970."
"The fundamental concept behind MHD is that magnetic fields can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself."
The set of equations that describe MHD are a combination of the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and Maxwell’s equations of electro­magnetism.
"These differential equations must be solved simultaneously, either analytically or numerically."
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
"Cuba ( (listen) KEW-bə, Spanish: [ˈkuβa] (listen)), officially the Republic of Cuba (Spanish: República de Cuba [reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkuβa] (listen)), is a country comprising the island of Cuba, as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos."
"Cuba is located where the northern Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean meet."
"Cuba is located at the east of the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico), south of both the American state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic), and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands."
Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey.
"The official area of the Republic of Cuba is 109,884 km2 (42,426 sq mi) (without the territorial waters)."
"The main island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean, with an area of 104,556 km2 (40,369 sq mi)."
"Cuba is the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Haiti, with over 11 million inhabitants.The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century."
"From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902."
"As a fragile republic, in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952."
"Open corruption and oppression under Batista's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro."
"Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba."
"The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962."
"Cuba is one of a few extant Marxist–Leninist socialist states, where the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution."
"Under Castro, Cuba was involved in a broad range of military and humanitarian activities throughout both Africa and Asia.Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America."
"It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the Taíno Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of enslaved Africans and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War."
"Cuba is a founding member of the United Nations, the G77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, ALBA and the Organization of American States."
"It has currently one of the world's only planned economies, and its economy is dominated by the tourism industry and the exports of skilled labor, sugar, tobacco, and coffee."
"Cuba has historically – both before and during Communist rule – performed better than other countries in the region on several socioeconomic indicators, such as literacy, infant mortality and life expectancy.Cuba has a single-party authoritarian regime where political opposition is not permitted."
"There are elections in Cuba, but they are not considered democratic."
"Censorship of information (including limits to internet access) is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom."
"Produce is a generalized term for many farm-produced crops, including fruits and vegetables (grains, oats, etc."
are also sometimes considered produce).
"More specifically, the term produce often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were harvested."
"In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept."
"Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets."
"The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries."
"In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes."
These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.
Letterkenny is a Canadian comedy television series created by Jared Keeso and developed by Keeso and Jacob Tierney.
"The series' first season premiered on CraveTV on February 7, 2016."
"Throughout its run, the series has featured a variety of actors in both long-term lead roles and inconsistent supporting appearances."
Nineteen cast members have appeared in every season.
"The pilot episode opens with the text ""Letterkenny consists of hicks, skids, hockey players and Christians."
"These are their problems."""
"While the latter group was phased out early on, the structure of the show revolves around the other three groups of characters."
"A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state."
"In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary."
"Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy."
"In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy."
"While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations."
"Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy and tyranny."
"The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession."
The giraffe is a tall African mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
"Specifically, It is an even-toed ungulate."
It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
"Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies."
"Most recently, researchers proposed dividing giraffes into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements."
Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
"The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns."
"It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi."
"Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east."
Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.
"Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach."
"Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes."
"Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations."
"Males establish social hierarchies through ""necking,” which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon."
"Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young."
"The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons."
It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range.
"Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild."
"More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010."
"A guide is a person who leads travelers, sportsmen, or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations."
The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.
Observation is the active acquisition of information from a primary source.
"In living beings, observation employs the senses."
"In science, observation can also involve the perception and recording of data via the use of scientific instruments."
The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity.
"Observations can be qualitative, that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or quantitative if a numerical value is attached to the observed phenomenon by counting or measuring."
"The apostrophe (' or ’) is a punctuation mark, and sometimes a diacritical mark, in languages that use the Latin alphabet and some other alphabets."
"In English, the apostrophe is used for three basic purposes:

The marking of the omission of one or more letters, e.g."
"the contraction of ""do not"" to ""don't""."
"The marking of possessive case of nouns (as in ""the eagle's feathers"", ""in one month's time"", ""at your parents'‌ [home]"")."
"The marking of plurals in a few distinctive cases, e.g."
"""p's and q's"" or Oakland A's.The word ""apostrophe"" comes ultimately from Greek ἡ ἀπόστροφος [προσῳδία] (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], '[the accent of] turning away or elision'), through Latin and French.For use in computer systems, Unicode has code points for three different forms of apostrophe."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment.
"It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about."
"A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick."
"Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic."
"Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata)."
"The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction."
"Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass."
"Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets."
"A curtain is a piece of cloth or other material intended to block or obscure light, air drafts, or (in the case of a shower curtain), water."
A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theater that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop/background.Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.
"For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons)."
"In this application, they are also known as ""draperies""."
Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portières.
"Curtains come in a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, colors, and patterns."
"They often have their own sections within department stores, while some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains."
"Curtains vary according to cleanability, ultraviolet light deterioration, oil and dust retention, noise absorption, fire resistance, and life span."
"Curtains may be operated by hand, with cords, by press-button pads or remote-controlled computers."
They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.
"Measuring curtain sizes needed for each window varies greatly according to the type of curtain needed, window size, and type and weight of curtain."
Curtains are a form of window treatment and complete the overall appearance of the interior of the house.
Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.
"The effect of drapery or curtains is best seen in daylight, and with proper indoor light positioning, can look attractive even at night."
"Religion is usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements; however, there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacred things, faith, a supernatural being or supernatural beings or ""some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life""."
"Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities and/or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture."
"Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life."
"Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that may also attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena."
"Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide."
"About 84% of the world's population is affiliated with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or some form of folk religion."
"The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics."
"While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally, many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies."
"Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief."
A dress (also known as a frock or a gown) is a garment traditionally worn by women or girls consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment).
It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs.
"A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length, and can be formal or casual."
"A dress can have sleeves, straps, or be held up with elastic around the chest, leaving the shoulders bare."
Dresses also vary in color.
"The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty, weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer."
"Working capital (abbreviated WC) is a financial metric which represents operating liquidity available to a business, organization, or other entity, including governmental entities."
"Along with fixed assets such as plant and equipment, working capital is considered a part of operating capital."
Gross working capital is equal to current assets.
Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.
"If current assets are less than current liabilities, an entity has a working capital deficiency, also called a working capital deficit and Negative Working capital."
A company can be endowed with assets and profitability but may fall short of liquidity if its assets cannot be readily converted into cash.
Positive working capital is required to ensure that a firm is able to continue its operations and that it has sufficient funds to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses.
"The management of working capital involves managing inventories, accounts receivable and payable, and cash."
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work.
The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).
The heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine.
"Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion."
"Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy."
"Hydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized."
"Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir)."
A baker is a tradesperson who bakes and sometimes sells breads and other products made of flour by using an oven or other concentrated heat source.
The place where a baker works is called a bakery.
"A suburb (or suburban area or suburbia) is a commercial, mixed-use or residential area."
It can exist either as part of a city/urban area and can often have a large degree of employment.
In some metropolitan areas they exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city.
"Suburbs might have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities."
"In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a ""neighborhood"" in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas.In some areas, such as Australia, India, China, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl."
"In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough."
"In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are exurbs or ""exurban areas"", with less population density (but still more than rural areas) but linked to the metropolitan area economically, particularly by commuters."
"Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting."
"In general, they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs, planned communities and satellite cities."
Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.
"A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath."
"It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross."
"There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations."
"Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it."
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones.
The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
"The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use."
Jelly beans are small bean-shaped sugar candies with soft candy shells and thick gel interiors (see gelatin and jelly).
The confection is primarily made of sugar and sold in a wide variety of colors and flavors.
An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent.
Uncles who are related by birth are second-degree relatives.
"The female counterpart of an uncle is an aunt, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece."
"The word comes from Latin: avunculus, the diminutive of avus (grandfather), and is a family relationship within an extended or imediate family."
"In some cultures and families,  children may refer to the cousins of their parents as uncle (or aunt)."
"It is also used as a title of respect for older relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, family friends, and even total strangers in some cultures, for example Aboriginal Australian elders."
Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship.
Any social institution where a special relationship exists between a man and his sisters' children is known as an avunculate (or avunculism or avuncularism).
"This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society."
"Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and matrilineal descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society."
"In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls."
"In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept."
"Later in the Middle Ages, the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept."
"As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there."
It was usually immediately inside the main door.
"In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor."
"Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly."
"Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard), or hallway."
A trust is a legal relationship in which the holder of a right gives it to another person or entity who must keep and use it solely for another's benefit.
"In Anglo-American common law, the party who entrusts the right is known as the ""settlor"", the party to whom the right is entrusted is known as the ""trustee"", the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the ""beneficiary"", and the entrusted property itself is known as the ""corpus"" or ""trust property""."
"With the strategic and legal use of Trusts, individuals can ensure that their children and grandchildren or chosen beneficiaries are able to benefit completely from the inheritance they want them to receive."
A testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor.
An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument.
"A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma and Texas (and any other state that has adopted section 602 of the Uniform Trust Code), in which trusts are presumed to be revocable unless the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable."
"An irrevocable trust can be ""broken"" (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding."
"The trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust, as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner(s) of the trust property."
Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners.
They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures.
Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses.
A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches their fiduciary duty.
Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offenses in a court of law.
"A trustee can be a natural person, a business entity or a public body."
A trust in the United States may be subject to federal and state taxation.
"A trust is created by a settlor, who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries."
The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created.
"In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed."
"It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role."
"For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.Trusts have existed since Roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law."
"Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations; understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky."
"Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain."
"An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits."
"This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased."
"Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries."
"While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries."
"The primary duties owed are those of loyalty, prudence and impartiality."
Trustees may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings to enforce their behavior.
"To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including duties of openness and transparency, and duties of recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure."
"In addition, a trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law."
"The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties and neither endebt nor riskily speculate on the trust assets without the written, clear permission of all of the adult beneficiaries."
There are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with a conflict of interest.
"Courts can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they find a trustee has failed in any of his or her duties."
Such a failure is a civil breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for the breach.
It is highly advisable for settlors and in many cases trustees to seek qualified legal counsel (advice) before entering into or creating a trust agreement and trustees must take great care in acting or omitting to act to avoid unlawful mistakes.
"Palm wine, known by several local names, is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various species of palm tree such as the palmyra, date palms, and coconut palms."
"It is known by various names in different regions and is common in various parts of Africa, the Caribbean, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Micronesia."
Palm wine production by smallholders and individual farmers may promote conservation as palm trees become a source of regular household income that may economically be worth more than the value of timber sold.
"A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element."
"The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is a harmonic oscillator: It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates."
"From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, inspired by Galileo Galilei, until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use."
"Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices, and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation."
Their greater accuracy allowed for the faster pace of life which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution.
"The home pendulum clock was replaced by less-expensive, synchronous, electric clocks in the 1930s and '40s."
Pendulum clocks are now kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.
Pendulum clocks must be stationary to operate.
"Any motion or accelerations will affect the motion of the pendulum, causing inaccuracies, thus necessitating other mechanisms for use in portable timepieces."
"Arithmetic (from the Greek ἀριθμός arithmos, 'number' and τική [τέχνη], tiké [téchne], 'art' or 'craft') is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially concerning the properties of the traditional operations on them—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and extraction of roots."
"Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis."
"The terms arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for number theory, and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory."
"Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol) is an organic chemical compound."
It is a simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H6O.
"Its formula can be also written as CH3−CH2−OH or C2H5OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH."
"Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a characteristic wine-like odor and pungent taste."
"It is a psychoactive drug, recreational drug, and the active ingredient in alcoholic drinks."
Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes such as ethylene hydration.
It has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant.
It is used as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds.
Ethanol is a fuel source.
Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.
"They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans."
"Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere."
"Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia."
"Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails."
"While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets."
"With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals."
They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.
"Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers."
"Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days."
"Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance."
"With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies."
"In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market."
"The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries."
"The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing."
"Flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e."
air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e.
spaceflight).
"This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement."
"Many things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.)"
and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.
"The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles."
"Bees are insects with wings closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey."
Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea.
"They are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila."
"There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families."
"Some species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in colonies while most species (>90%) – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary."
"Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants."
"The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies."
"Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to Megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in)."
"Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients."
Most pollen is used as food for their larvae.
Vertebrate predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.
"Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees."
"The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.Human beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture for stingless bees) has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece."
"Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common."
"In Mesoamerica, the Mayans have practiced large-scale intensive meliponiculture since pre-Columbian times."
A boy is a young male human.
The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent.
"When a male human reaches adulthood, he is described as a man."
The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena.
Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves.
"These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation."
"They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion."
Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed.
"Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent."
Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals.
Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed.
Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states.
Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind.
"According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental."
"For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play."
"Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition."
"Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality."
The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem.
"Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical."
"Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters."
Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).
"For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines."
"Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions."
Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g.
"panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities."
"Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers."
"Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind."
"The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind."
The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.
"Red currant may refer to:

Ribes rubrum, a shrub native to western Europe and widely cultivated
Ribes sanguineum, a shrub native to North America
Searsia chirindensis a tree native to southern Africa"
A plough or plow (US; both ) is a farm tool for loosening or turning the soil before sowing seed or planting.
"Ploughs were traditionally drawn by oxen and horses, but in modern farms are drawn by tractors."
"A plough may have a wooden, iron or steel frame, with a blade attached to cut and loosen the soil."
It has been fundamental to farming for most of history.
The earliest ploughs had no wheels; such a plough was known to the Romans as an aratrum.
"Celtic peoples first came to use wheeled ploughs in the Roman era.The prime purpose of ploughing is to turn over the uppermost soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while burying weeds and crop remains to decay."
Trenches cut by the plough are called furrows.
"In modern use, a ploughed field is normally left to dry and then harrowed before planting."
"Ploughing and cultivating soil evens the content of the upper 12 to 25 centimetres (5 to 10 in) layer of soil, where most plant-feeder roots grow."
"Ploughs were initially powered by humans, but the use of farm animals was considerably more efficient."
The earliest animals worked were oxen.
"Later, horses and mules were used in many areas."
With the industrial revolution came the possibility of steam engines to pull ploughs.
These in turn were superseded by internal-combustion-powered tractors in the early 20th century.
Use of the traditional plough has decreased in some areas threatened by soil damage and erosion.
Used instead is shallower ploughing or other less-invasive conservation tillage.
"An award, sometimes called a distinction, is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field."
"When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration."
"An award may be described by three aspects: 1) who is given 2) what 3) by whom, all varying according to purpose."
"The recipient is often to a single person, such as a student or athlete, or a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country."
"The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal, badge, or rosette (award)."
"It can also be a token object such as certificate, diploma, championship belt, trophy, or plaque."
"The award may also be or be accompanied by a title of honor, as well as an object of direct value such as prize money or a scholarship."
"Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient(s) a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way."
"An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority (see fount of honour), or else a private organisation or individual."
"The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards."
"For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements."
"An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize."
"Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests."
The Stanley Cup is a modern example.
"In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces."
An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient.
"Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory."
"There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools.A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations."
"A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans."
It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.
"Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing."
"Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space."
"The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales, from the microscale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet."
"The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines - topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics."
The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.
"Parrots, also known as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 398 species in 92 genera comprising the order Psittaciformes , found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions."
"The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (""true"" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots)."
"One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group."
"Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well."
The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.
"Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet."
"Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured."
Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum.
They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length.
"The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material."
"A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits."
"Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young."
"Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets."
"Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds."
Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.
"A body cavity search, also known simply as a cavity search, is either a visual search or a manual internal inspection of body cavities for prohibited materials (contraband), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons."
"Body cavities frequently used for concealment include the mouth, vagina, and rectum."
"It is far more invasive than the standard strip search that is typically performed on individuals taken into custody, either upon police arrest or incarceration at a jail, prison, or psychiatric hospital."
Often the procedure is repeated when the person leaves the institution.
Body cavity searches may also be conducted at some international border crossings such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when they suspect international travelers of hiding contraband—such as drugs
"Primogeniture ( also ) is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate child to inherit the parent's entire or main estate in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative."
In most contexts it means the inheritance of the firstborn son (agnatic primogeniture); it can also mean by the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture).
"Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems."
The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).
"A motel, also known as a motor hotel or motor lodge, is a hotel designed for motorists, usually having each room entered directly from the parking area for motor vehicles rather than through a central lobby."
"Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word motel, coined as a portmanteau of ""motor hotel"", originates from the Milestone Mo-Tel of San Luis Obispo, California (now called the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo), which was built in 1925."
"The term referred to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking."
"Motels are often individually owned, though motel chains do exist."
"As large highway systems began to be developed in the 1920s, long-distance road journeys became more common, and the need for inexpensive, easily accessible overnight accommodation sites close to the main routes led to the growth of the motel concept."
"Motels peaked in popularity in the 1960s with rising car travel, only to decline in response to competition from the newer chain hotels that became commonplace at highway interchanges as traffic was bypassed onto newly constructed freeways."
Several historic motels are listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.
"A toilet is a piece of sanitary hardware that collects human urine and feces, and sometimes toilet paper, usually for disposal."
"Flush toilets use water, while dry or non-flush toilets do not."
"They can be designed for a sitting position popular in Europe and North America with a toilet seat, with additional considerations for those with disabilities, or for a squatting posture more popular in Asia (see squat toilet)."
"In urban areas, flush toilets are usually connected to a sewer system that leads to septic tanks in isolated areas."
The waste is known as blackwater and the combined effluent including other sources is sewage.
"Dry toilets are connected to a pit, removable container, composting chamber, or other storage and treatment device, including urine diversion with a urine-diverting toilet."
The technology used for modern toilets varies.
"Toilets are commonly made of ceramic (porcelain), concrete, plastic, or wood."
"Newer toilet technologies include dual flushing, low flushing, toilet seat warming, self-cleaning, female urinals and waterless urinals."
Japan is known for its toilet technology.
Airplane toilets are specially designed to operate in the air.
"The need to maintain anal hygiene post-defecation is universally recognized and toilet paper (often held by a toilet roll holder), which may also be used to wipe the vulva after urination, is widely used (as well as bidets)."
"In private homes, depending on the region and style, the toilet may exist in the same bathroom as the sink, bath, and shower."
"Another option is to have one room for body washing (also called ""bathroom"") and a separate one for the toilet and handwashing sink (toilet room)."
Public toilets (restrooms) consist of one or more toilets (and commonly single urinals or trough urinals) which are available for use by the general public.
Products like urinal blocks and toilet blocks help maintain the smell and cleanliness of toilets.
Toilet seat covers are sometimes used.
"Portable toilets (frequently chemical ""porta johns"") may be brought in for large and temporary gatherings."
"Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements."
"However, many poor households in developing countries use very basic, and often unhygienic, toilets - and nearly one billion people have no access to a toilet at all; they must openly defecate and urinate."
"Or else they must resort to a ""flying toilet"": a plastic bag."
"These issues can lead to the spread of diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route, or the transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea."
"Therefore, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 wants to ""achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation""."
A fact is something that is true.
"The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability, that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience."
Standard reference works are often used to check facts.
Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.
"For example, ""This sentence contains words."""
"accurately describes a linguistic fact, and ""The sun is a star"" accurately describes an astronomical fact."
"Further, ""Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States"" and ""Abraham Lincoln was assassinated"" both accurately describe historical facts."
"Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion."
The Chair is an American comedy-drama streaming television series.
"The series was released on Netflix on August 20, 2021."
"It is set at the fictional Pembroke University, ""in what seems like New England""."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which are located on tracks."
"In contrast to road transport, where the vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run."
"Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on sleepers (ties) set in ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves."
"Other variations are also possible, such as ""slab track"", in which the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface."
"Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional resistance than rubber-tired road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains."
"The operation is carried out by a railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer facilities."
"Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by diesel engines or, historically, steam engines."
Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system.
Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.
"Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilisation and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered."
"The oldest known, man/animal-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC in Corinth, Greece."
Rail transport then commenced in mid 16th century in Germany in the form of horse-powered funiculars and wagonways.
Modern rail transport commenced with the British development of the steam locomotive in Merthyr Tydfil when Richard Trevithick ran a steam locomotive and loaded wagons between Penydarren Ironworks and Abercynon in 1802.
Thus the railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.
"Built by George Stephenson and his son Robert's company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion No."
"1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825."
"George Stephenson also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use only the steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830."
"With steam engines, one could construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution."
"Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships."
"The change from canals to railways allowed for ""national markets"" in which prices varied very little from city to city."
"The spread of the railway network and the use of railway timetables, led to the standardisation of time (railway time) in Britain based on Greenwich Mean Time."
"Prior to this, major towns and cities varied their local time relative to GMT."
The invention and development of the railway in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century.
"The world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway (part of the London Underground), opened in 1863."
"In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, leading to electrification of tramways and rapid transit systems."
"Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by the 2000s."
"During the 1960s, electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in some other countries."
"Many countries are in the process of replacing diesel locomotives with electric locomotives, mainly due to environmental concerns, a notable example being Switzerland, which has completely electrified its network."
"Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen limited use."
"Following a decline after World War II due to competition from cars and aeroplanes, rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming."
Humour (Commonwealth English) or humor (American English) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement.
"The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: humor, ""body fluid""), controlled human health and emotion."
People of all ages and cultures respond to humour.
"Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny (such as a pun or joke)—and thus are considered to have a sense of humour."
"The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational."
"Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context."
"For example, young children may favour slapstick such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or the Tom and Jerry cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them."
"By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience."
"The sea, connected as the world ocean or simply the ocean, is the body of salty water that covers approximately 71 percent of the Earth's surface."
"The word sea is also used to denote second-order sections of the sea, such as the Mediterranean Sea, as well as certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes, such as the Caspian Sea."
"The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle."
"Humans harnessing and studying the sea have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography."
The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride.
"The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations."
"Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans."
"Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves, which break when they enter the shallow water."
"Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans."
"The directions of the circulation are governed by factors, including the shapes of the continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect)."
"Deep-sea currents, known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean."
"Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun."
Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
"Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites."
"A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions."
Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.
"The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater."
"Other human uses of the sea include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving."
Many of these activities create marine pollution.
The sea has therefore been for humans an integral element throughout history and culture.
"A computer file is a computer resource for recording data in a computer storage device, primarily identified by its file name."
"Just as words can be written to paper, so can data be written to a computer file."
Files can be edited and transferred through the Internet on that particular computer system.
Different types of computer files are designed for different purposes.
"A file may be designed to store a Image, a written message, a video, a computer program, or any wide variety of other kinds of data."
Certain files can store multiple data types at once.
"By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file."
"Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times."
"Files are typically organized in a file system, which tracks file locations on the disk and enables user access."
A son is a male offspring; a boy or man in relation to his parents.
The female counterpart is a daughter.
"From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative."
"A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats."
"Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas."
"However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment."
"In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship."
"Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called ""boats""."
"Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions."
"Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport."
Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions.
"Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats."
House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence.
Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore.
Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.
Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g.
"rowboats and paddle boats), wind  (e.g."
"sailboats), and motor (including gasoline, diesel, and electric)."
Dust bunnies (or dustbunnies) are small clumps of dust that form under furniture and in corners that are not cleaned regularly.
"They are made of hair, lint, flakes of dead skin, spider webs, dust and sometimes light rubbish and debris and are held together by static electricity and felt-like entanglement."
They can house dust mites or other parasites and can lower the efficiency of dust filters by clogging them.
"The movement of a single large particle can start the formation of a dust bunny.Dust bunnies are harmful to electronics because they can obstruct air flow through heat sinks, raising temperatures significantly and therefore shortening the life of electronic components.An American trademark for ""Dustbunny"" was registered in 2006 for the ""Dustbunny Cleaner"", a robotic ball with an electrostatic sleeve that rolls around under furniture to collect dust bunnies and other material."
Dust bunnies have been used as an analogy for the accretion of cosmic matter in planetoids.
"The convertible peso (sometimes given as CUC$ and informally called a cuc or a chavito) was one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the Cuban peso."
"It had been in limited use since 1994, when its value was pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar."
"On 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar ceased to be accepted in Cuban retail outlets and left the convertible peso as the only currency in circulation in many Cuban businesses."
"Officially exchangeable only within the country, its value was increased to US$1.08 in April 2005, but reverted to US$1.00 on 15 March 2011."
"The convertible peso was, by the pegged rate, the twelfth-highest-valued currency unit in the world and the highest-valued ""peso"" unit."
"On 22 October 2013, it was announced that the currency was to be scrapped."
"On 10 December 2020, it was announced that monetary unification would take effect from 1 January 2021."
"From that date, the CUC was no longer accepted in many Cuban businesses; it could only be exchanged in banks or CADECAs (casas de cambios), or used in certain shops, for a six-month period."
"On 15 June 2021, it was announced that the CUC would remain exchangeable in banks for a further six months but that no shops would accept them from 1 July."
The final date for exchanging CUCs was 30 December 2021.
"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.
It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities.
"A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of bracelet."
"A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain."
"Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century."
"During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel."
These are called mechanical watches.
"In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal."
By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.
"Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland)."
"Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist."
"They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities."
"In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year."
"For mechanical watches, various extra features called ""complications,"" such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included."
"Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions."
"Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time."
Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements.
"However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones."
"As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014."
"As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref."
"6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019."
"Antidepressants are medications used to treat major depressive disorder, some anxiety disorders, some chronic pain conditions, and to help manage some addictions."
"Common side-effects of antidepressants include dry mouth, weight gain, dizziness, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and emotional blunting."
"There is a slight increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior when taken by children, adolescents, and young adults."
A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant which resembles recurrent depression.Some reviews of antidepressants for depression in adults find benefit while others do not.
Evidence of benefit in children and adolescents is unclear.
The twenty-one most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications were found to be more effective than placebo for adults with major depressive disorder in a 2016 meta-study.
"There is debate in the medical community about how much of the observed effects of antidepressants can be attributed to the placebo effect, with some claiming that there is no effect above and beyond it."
"Most research on whether antidepressant drugs work is done on people with very severe symptoms, a population who exhibits much weaker placebo responses, so the results cannot be extrapolated to the general population.There are effective treatments for depression which do not involve medications or may be used in conjunction with medications."
"Modern Times is a 1936 American silent comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world."
"The film is a commentary on the desperate employment and financial conditions many people faced during the Great Depression — conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization."
"The movie stars Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin."
It is notable for being the last time that Chaplin portrayed the Tramp character and for being the first time Chaplin's voice is heard on film.
"In 1989, Modern Times was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""."
"In 2003, it was screened ""out of competition"" at the Cannes Film Festival."
Earl () is a rank of the nobility in the United Kingdom.
"The title originates in the Old English word eorl, meaning ""a man of noble birth or rank""."
"The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant ""chieftain"", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead."
"In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (hertig/hertug/hertog)."
"After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer)."
"However, earlier in Scandinavia, jarl could also mean a sovereign prince."
"For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of jarl and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king."
"Alternative names for the rank equivalent to ""earl"" or ""count"" in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the hakushaku (伯爵) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era."
"In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount."
"A feminine form of earl never developed; instead, countess is used."
"The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder."
Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
"Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing."
"Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes."
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.
"Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order."
"In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property."
Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies.
"Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule."
"A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard."
"Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards."
"Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members."
The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.Numerous slang terms exist for the police.
Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies.
"One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession."
Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.
"They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research."
They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
"The fossil record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago."
"Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds."
"Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints."
"Birds, at over 10,700 living species, are among the most diverse group of vertebrates."
"Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs."
Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains.
"Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded."
"Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction."
"Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous."
"Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying; and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian."
"While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances."
"Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines."
"While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were the largest land animals of all time."
"The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized."
"Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length."
"The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name ""dinosaur"" (meaning ""terrible lizard"") having been coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1841 to refer to these ""great fossil lizards""."
"Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture."
"The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park."
"Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media."
Annona reticulata is a small deciduous or semi-evergreen tree in the plant family Annonaceae and part of the Annonas group.
"It is best known for its fruit, called custard apple, a common name shared with fruits of several other species in the same genus: A. cherimola and A. squamosa."
"Its common names include wild sweetsop, soursop and bullock's heart."
"The fruit is sweet and useful in preparation of desserts, but is generally less popular for eating than that of A. cherimola."
A uniform is a variety of clothing worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity.
"Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in prisons."
"In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects."
"For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform."
"Tomato paste is a thick paste made by cooking tomatoes for several hours to reduce the water content, straining out the seeds and skins, and cooking the liquid again to reduce the base to a thick, rich concentrate."
"It is used to impart an intense tomato flavour to a variety of dishes, such as pasta, soups and braised meat."
"By contrast, tomato purée is a liquid with a thinner consistency than tomato paste, while tomato sauce is even thinner in consistency."
"A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national), and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs.The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC."
"A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law."
Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.
"Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government."
"Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts."
Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income.
"Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs."
"In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government."
This has effects that can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare.
"Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic."
"A line of credit is a credit facility extended by a bank or other financial institution to a government, business or individual customer that enables the customer to draw on the facility when the customer needs funds."
"A line of credit takes several forms, such as an overdraft limit, demand loan, special purpose, export packing credit, term loan, discounting, purchase of commercial bills, traditional revolving credit card account, etc."
It is effectively a source of funds that can readily be tapped at the borrower's discretion.
Interest is paid only on money actually withdrawn.
"Lines of credit can be secured by collateral, or may be unsecured."
"Lines of credit are often extended by banks, financial institutions and other licensed consumer lenders to creditworthy customers (though certain special-purpose lines of credit may not have creditworthiness requirements) to address fluctuating cash flow needs of the customer."
The maximum amount of funds a customer is allowed to draw from a line of credit is typically called the credit limit or overdraft limit.
The term credit limit is commonly used for credit cards whereas the term overdraft limit is more commonly used for bank accounts.
"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally."
"In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly orange yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal."
"Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element."
It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.
"Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits."
"It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite."
"Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides)."
"Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion."
"Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term acid test."
"Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating."
"Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction."
"A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history."
"In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971."
"A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020."
This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft).
"The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
"Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use)."
"Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration."
Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.
"As of 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."

Vic Niblett (1924–2004), English footballer"
Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera.
"With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight."
"Bats are more maneuverable than most birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium."
"The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass."
"The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in)."
"The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species."
"These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats."
"But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats."
"Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters)."
"A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood."
"Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators."
"Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions."
They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.
"Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages."
Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser.
"Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides and other insect management measures."
"They are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim."
"However, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by fruit growers."
"Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves."
"If humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans."
"Depending on the culture, bats may be symbolically associated with positive traits, such as protection from certain diseases or risks, rebirth, or long life, but in the West, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, vampires, and death."
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent.
Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives.
Known alternate terms include auntie or aunty.
Children in other cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap.
"The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece."
"A dental drill or handpiece is a hand-held, mechanical instrument used to perform a variety of common dental procedures, including removing decay, polishing fillings, performing cosmetic dentistry, and altering prostheses."
"The handpiece itself consists of internal mechanical components which initiate a rotational force and provide power to the cutting instrument, usually a dental burr."
The type of apparatus used clinically will vary depending on the required function dictated by the dental procedure.
"It is common for a light source and cooling water-spray system to also be incorporated into certain handpieces; this improves visibility, accuracy and overall success of the procedure."
The burrs are usually made of tungsten carbide or diamond.
"Yogurt (UK: ; US: , from Turkish: yoğurt)  also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk."
The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures.
"Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor."
Cow's milk is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt.
"Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks are also used to produce yogurt."
The milk used may be homogenized or not.
It may be pasteurized or raw.
Each type of milk produces substantially different results.
Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria.
"In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt."
"Some countries require yogurt to contain a specific amount of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter.To produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds."
"After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °C (113 °F)."
"The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a warm temperature of 30-45 °C (86-113 °F) is maintained for 4 to 12 hours to allow fermentation to occur, with the higher temperatures working faster but risking a lumpy texture or whey separation."
"A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label."
"The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth."
Numbers can be represented in language with number words.
"More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, ""5"" is a numeral that represents the number five."
"As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number."
"The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits."
"In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs)."
"In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents."
"In mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half

    {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {2}}\right)}
   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples)."
"Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation."
"Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers."
"Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world."
"For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and ""a million"" may signify ""a lot"" rather than an exact quantity."
"Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought."
"Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept."
"Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system."
"In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as rings and fields, and the application of the term ""number"" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices associated with members of The First Church of Christ, Scientist."
"Adherents are commonly known as Christian Scientists or students of Christian Science, and the church is sometimes informally known as the Christian Science church."
"It was founded in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who wrote the 1875 book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, which outlined the theology of Christian Science."
"The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1879 to found the ""Church of Christ (Scientist)""; the church would be reorganized under the name ""Church of Christ, Scientist"" in 1892."
"The Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was built in Boston, Massachusetts in 1894."
"Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000, and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000."
"The church is known for its newspaper, The Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.Eddy described Christian Science as a return to ""primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing""."
There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity.
"In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion."
"This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, physicians for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine."
"Most controversially, the reliance on prayer and avoidance of medical treatment has been blamed for the deaths of several adherents and their children."
"Between the 1880s and 1990s, parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect."
"A used car, a pre-owned vehicle, or a secondhand car, is a vehicle that has previously had one or more retail owners."
"Used cars are sold through a variety of outlets, including franchise and independent car dealers, rental car companies, buy here pay here dealerships, leasing offices, auctions, and private party sales."
"Some car retailers offer ""no-haggle prices,"" ""certified"" used cars, and extended service plans or warranties."
"Norah Head Lightstation Precinct is a heritage-listed former lighthouse precinct located at Bush Street, Norah Head in the Central Coast local government area of New South Wales, Australia."
The Norah Head lighthouse and associated buildings were designed by Cecil W. Darley and built in 1903.
The precinct was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 April 2007.
"Iran (Persian: ایران Irān [ʔiːˈɾɒːn] (listen)), also called Persia, and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia."
"It is bordered to the west by Iraq and Turkey, to the northwest by Azerbaijan and Armenia, to the north by the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to the south by the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf."
"Iran covers an area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), making it the fourth-largest country entirely in Asia and the second-largest in Western Asia."
"Its population is 85 million, the 17th-most populous in the world."
The capital and largest city is Tehran.
"Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC."
"It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire, which became one of the largest empires in history and has been described as the world's first superpower."
The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was divided into several Hellenistic states.
"An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries."
"Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran."
"It subsequently became a major center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age."
"Over the next two centuries, a series of native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Mongols conquered the region."
"In the 15th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity and converted the country to Shia Islam."
"Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran once again became a major world power, though by the 19th century a series of conflicts with Russia led to significant territorial losses."
The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution.
"Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence."
He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963.
"After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first Supreme Leader."
"The Government of Iran is an Islamic theocracy which includes elements of a presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic ""Supreme Leader"", a position held by Ali Khamenei since Khomeini's death in 1989."
"The Iranian government is widely considered to be authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant constraints and abuses against human rights and civil liberties, including several violent suppressions of mass protests, unfair elections, and limited rights for women and children."
"It is also a focal point for Shia Islam within the Middle East, countering the long-existing Arab Sunni hegemony within the region, and is often considered Israel's largest adversary."
"The state is considered one of the biggest players within Middle Eastern affairs, with its government directly or indirectly involved in a majority of modern Middle Eastern conflicts."
"Iran is a regional and middle power, with a geopolitically strategic location in the Asian continent."
"It is a founding member of the United Nations, the ECO, the OIC, and the OPEC."
It has large reserves of fossil fuels—including the world's second-largest natural gas supply and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves.
The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
"Historically a multinational state, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, the largest being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis and Lurs."
"Leafy spurge may refer to several species of plant in the genus Euphorbia, including:

Euphorbia esula
Euphorbia virgata"
"A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun."
"Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility."
"In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter."
"In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked."
"A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar."
"The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars (see below)."
"For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days."
"In English, the abbreviations ""y"" and ""yr"" are commonly used (""a"" is also used) for the unit of time, though its exact duration may be inconsistent."
"In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc."
"Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit."
"The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year."
"Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons."
"Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere)."
Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.
Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere).
One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
"Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as ""mid-autumn"", while others with a longer temperature lag treat the equinox as the start of autumn."
"In the English-speaking world, autumn traditionally began with Lammas Day and ended around Hallowe'en, the approximate mid-points between midsummer, the autumnal equinox, and midwinter."
"Meteorologists (and Australia and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere."
"In North America, autumn traditionally starts with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and ends with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December)."
"Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date."
"As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees change colour and then shed their leaves.In traditional East Asian solar term, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November."
"In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann, are September, October and November."
"However, according to the Irish Calendar, which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition."
"In the Irish language, September is known as Meán Fómhair (""middle of autumn"") and October as Deireadh Fómhair (""end of autumn"")."
Persians celebrate the beginning of the autumn as Mehregan to honor Mithra (Mehr).
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"In geology, a rock (or stone) is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter."
"It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed."
"Rocks form the Earth's outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior, except for the liquid outer core and pockets of magma in the asthenosphere."
"Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks."
"Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth's crust, or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed."
"Sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments, which in turn are formed by the weathering, transport, and deposition of existing rocks."
"Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such high pressures and temperatures that they are transformed—something that occurs, for example, when continental plates collide."
": 31–33, 134–139 The scientific study of the character and origin of rocks is called petrology, which is an essential subdiscipline of geology."
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent.
"The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent."
"The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions."
"Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median."
"Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females."
"Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict."
These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes.
"Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group."
People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop post-traumatic stress disorder.
Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
"A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, sometimes, from the victim's family and relatives."
The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena.
Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves.
"These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation."
"They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion."
Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed.
"Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent."
Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals.
Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed.
Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states.
Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind.
"According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental."
"For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play."
"Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition."
"Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality."
The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem.
"Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical."
"Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters."
Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).
"For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines."
"Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions."
Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g.
"panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities."
"Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers."
"Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind."
"The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind."
The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment.
"It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about."
"A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick."
"Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic."
"Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata)."
"The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction."
"Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass."
"Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets."
"In human society, family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship)."
The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society.
"Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community."
"In most societies, it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family, and acts as the primary source of attachment, nurturing, and socialization for humans."
"Additionally, as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a person into a functional adult, transmits culture, and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge."
"Anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children); patrifocal (a father and his children); conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family); avuncular (for example, a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family)."
"Members of the immediate family may include spouses, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters."
"Members of the extended family may include aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law."
"Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them, and the legal definition of ""immediate family"" varies."
Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo.
The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history.
The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics.
"The word ""families"" can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village."
"The ukulele ( YOO-kə-LAY-lee; from Hawaiian: ʻukulele [ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ], approximately OO-koo-LEH-leh)  is a member of the lute family of instruments of Portuguese origin and popularized in Hawaii."
It generally employs four nylon strings.The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction.
"Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone."
"Do-it-yourself biology (DIY biology, DIY bio) is a growing biotechnological social movement in which individuals, communities, and small organizations study biology and life science using the same methods as traditional research institutions."
"DIY biology is primarily undertaken by individuals with limited research training from academia or corporations, who then mentor and oversee other DIY biologists with little or no formal training."
"This may be done as a hobby, as a not-for-profit endeavour for community learning and open-science innovation, or for profit, to start a business."
Other terms are also associated with the do-it-yourself biology community.
The terms biohacking and wetware hacking emphasize the connection to hacker culture and the hacker ethic.
The term hacker is used in the original sense of finding new and clever ways to do things.
"The term biohacking is also used by the grinder body modification community, which is considered related but distinct from the do-it-yourself biology movement."
"The term biopunk emphasizes the techno-progressive, political, and artistic elements of the movement."
"A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes."
It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis.
"A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
"A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases."
"A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual."
"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources."
"Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet."
"The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example."
"Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning."
"Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet."
Hence managing information in an information world has become very easy simply because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.
"The services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination ""library and information services"", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently."
News is information about current events.
"This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events."
"News is sometimes called ""hard news"" to differentiate it from soft media."
"Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events."
"Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times."
"Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content."
The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper.
"Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems."
The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).
"A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory."
"Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons."
To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.
"Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work."
A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).
"Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression."
"In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures."
"Rhododendron menziesii, also classified as Menziesia ferruginea, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, known by several common names, including rusty menziesia, false huckleberry, fool's huckleberry and mock azalea."
"Sweatpants are a casual variety of soft trousers intended for comfort or athletic purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations."
"In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa they are known as tracksuit bottoms."
"In Australia and New Zealand, they are also commonly known as trackpants, trackies or tracky daks."
"A vine (Latin vīnea ""grapevine"", ""vineyard"", from vīnum ""wine"") is any plant with a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or runners."
"The word vine can also refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance, when used in wicker work.In parts of the world, including the British Isles, the term ""vine"" usually applies exclusively to grapevines (Vitis), while the term ""climber"" is used for all climbing plants."
A cloak of invisibility is a fictional theme.
"In folklore, mythology and fairy tales, a cloak of invisibility appears either as a magical item used by duplicitous characters or an item worn by a hero to fulfill a quest."
"It is a common theme in Welsh and Germanic folklore, and may originate with the cap of invisibility seen in ancient Greek myths."
"The motif falls under ""D1361.12 magic cloak of invisibility"" in the Stith Thompson motif index scheme."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Suggestion is the psychological process by which a person guides their own or another person's desired thoughts, feelings, and behaviors by presenting stimuli that may elicit them as reflexes instead of relying on conscious effort."
"Nineteenth-century writers on psychology such as William James used the words ""suggest"" and ""suggestion"" in the context of a particular idea which was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind."
"Early scientific studies of hypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (Hull, 1933)."
"The original neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideomotor reflex response that William B. Carpenter declared, in 1852, was the principle through which James Braid's hypnotic phenomena were produced."
"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science, and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption."
"Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions."
Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks.
Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans.
"It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for the same does not predate more than 1 million years.The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients."
"New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling of water, expanded cooking techniques."
Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.
Unearned increment is an increase in the value of land or any property without expenditure of any kind on the part of the proprietor; it is an early statement of the notion of unearned income.
"It was coined by John Stuart Mill, who proposed taxing it so that it benefits every member of a society."
Mill's concept was refined and developed by nineteenth-century economist Henry George in his book Progress and Poverty (1879).
George argued that the value of land increased as population growth expanded the division of labor.
A landowner’s exclusive claim to their land granted them the ability to collect the excess productivity as economic rent.
"Thorstein Veblen further developed the concept, pointing out that the value of a piece of land was also dependent on current technological capabilities."
"Veblen thought the unearned increment increased as the industrial arts advanced, so the argument could be extended from land to capital goods."
"Focusing on the role of technical knowledge in the creation and operation of capital, Veblen argues the unearned increment in the case of capital is in the monopolization of the community’s knowledge."
"As industrial methods advance and the unit of industrial equipment grows larger, it becomes feasible to monopolize the required materials for earning a living, effectively monopolizing a portion of the community’s knowledge."
"For both George and Veblen, the unearned increment emerges from the actions of an individual with the ability to exclusively use a community asset in order to generate profit."
The profit takes the form of an unearned increment because the individual reaping the profit didn’t create the land (or knowledge) used to do so.
Both thinkers also argued that such monopolization of the community’s resources would lead to the creation of economic slavery.
"The Crown is the state in all its aspects within the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth realms and their subdivisions (such as the Crown Dependencies, overseas territories, provinces, or states)."
"Legally ill-defined, the term has different meanings depending on context."
"It is used to designate the monarch in either a personal capacity, as Head of the Commonwealth, or as the king or queen of his or her realms."
"It can also refer to the rule of law; however, in common parlance 'The Crown' refers to the functions of government and the civil service.A corporation sole, the Crown is the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, and judicial governance in the monarchy of each commonwealth realm."
"These monarchies are united by the personal union of their monarch, but they are independent states."
The concept of the Crown developed first in England as a separation of the literal crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch.
"It spread through English and later British colonisation and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies, and the other 14 independent realms."
"It is not to be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British regalia.The term is also found in various expressions such as ""Crown land"", which some countries refer to as ""public land"" or ""state land""; as well as in some offices, such as minister of the Crown, Crown attorney, and Crown prosecutor."
A stove is a device that burns fuel or uses electricity to generate heat inside or on top of the apparatus.
It has seen many developments over time and serves the main purpose of cooking food.
"There are many types of stoves, such as the kitchen stove, the wood-burning stove or the coal stove."
"Each type of stove varies in efficiency of heat, as such, many different materials and designs have been developed for varying levels of efficiency and purpose."
"Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to improve the stove design over the years."
"Pellet stoves, for example, are a type of clean-burning stove."
"Whereas, air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely and therefore, reduce the amount of the combustion by-products."
"Another method of reducing air pollution is through the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas, for example, a filter or afterburner.All wood stoves manufactured In the United States since 1992 are required to limit emission of particulates.Research and development on safer and less emission releasing stoves is continuously evolving."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or as part of a festival or other commemoration or celebration of a special occasion."
"A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment."
"In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer, wine, or distilled spirits."
"More occasionally (though often in politics), a party can also simply refer to a group of people with a common objective."
Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are.
"In Physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g."
"""two counties over"")."
"The distance from a point A to a point B is sometimes denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        A
        B
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |AB|}
  ."
"In most cases, ""distance from A to B"" is interchangeable with ""distance from B to A""."
"In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance; it is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be ""close to"", or ""far away from"" each other."
"In psychology and social sciences, distance is a non-numerical measurement; Psychological distance is defined as ""the different ways in which an object might be removed from"" the self along dimensions such as ""time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality."
"A repayment plan is a structured repaying of funds that have been loaned to an individual, business or government over either a standard or extended period of time, typically alongside a payment of interest."
"Repayment plans are prominent within the financial industry of a national economy where liquid funds are in high demand to assist in investment opportunities, governmental expenditure or personal finance."
The term first saw prominence with its use by the International Monetary Fund to describe its form of financial loan repayment from individual nations.
"Typically, the term ""repayment plan"" refers to the system of Federal Student Aid in the United States of America, which assists in covering tertiary education expenses of domestic students."
"A stick figure, also known as stickman, is a very simple drawing of a person or animal, composed of a few lines, curves, and dots."
"On a stick figure, the head is most often represented by a circle, sometimes embellished with details such as eyes, a mouth, or hair."
"The arms, legs, and torso are usually represented by straight lines."
"Details such as hands, feet, and a neck may be present or absent; simpler stick figures often display an ambiguous emotional expression or disproportionate limbs.The stick figure is a universally recognizable symbol, in all likelihood one of the most well known in the world."
"It transcends language, location, demographics, and can trace back its roots for almost 30 000 years."
"Its simplicity and versatility led to the stick figure being used for a variety of purposes – info graphics, signage, comics, animations, games, film storyboards, and visual media of all kinds all employ the stick figure."
"With the advent of the world wide web, the stick figure became a central element within an entire genre of web-based interactive entertainment known as flash animation."
"Over a period of more than two decades, stick figure animation impacted and shaped the visual landscape of the internet."
A wish is a hope or desire for something.
"In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices."
"In folklore, opportunities for ""making a wish"" or for wishes to ""come true"" or ""be granted"" are themes that are sometimes used."
"Aka Manto (赤マント, Red Cloak), also known as Red Cape, Red Vest, Akai-Kami-Aoi-Kami (赤い紙青い紙, Red Paper, Blue Paper), or occasionally Aoi Manto (青マント, Blue Cloak), is a Japanese urban legend about a masked spirit who wears a red cloak, and who appears to people using toilets in public or school bathrooms."
"Accounts of the legend vary, but one consistent element of the story is that the spirit will ask the occupant of a toilet a question."
"In some versions, he will ask if they want red paper or blue paper, though other versions identify the choices as a red cloak or a blue cloak, or as a red cape or a blue cape."
"Choosing either option will result in the individual being killed, so the individual must ignore the spirit, run away, or reject both options in order to survive."
"An hourglass (or sandglass, sand timer, sand clock or egg timer) is a device used to measure the passage of time."
It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one.
"Typically, the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass will measure the same duration regardless of orientation."
"The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter, the bulb size, and the neck width."
"Depictions of an hourglass as a symbol of the passage of time are found in art, especially on tombstones or other monuments, from antiquity to the present day."
"The form of a winged hourglass has been used as a literal depiction of the well-known idiom ""time flies""."
A match is a tool for starting a fire.
"Typically, matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper."
One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by friction generated by striking the match against a suitable surface.
"Wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes, and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks."
"The coated end of a match, known as the match ""head"", consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder; often colored for easier inspection."
"There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used."
"Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes ."
"Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales."
"Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws."
"To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung."
Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
"Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards."
"These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae)."
"Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans."
"Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans."
"More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species."
"They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length."
The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.
"Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago."
"The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)."
The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.
Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans.
Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
"A bouncy ball or rubber ball is a spherical toy ball, usually fairly small, made of elastic material which allows it to bounce against hard surfaces."
"When thrown against a hard surface, bouncy balls retain their momentum and much of their kinetic energy (or, if dropped, convert much of their potential energy to kinetic energy)."
They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force.
"A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit."
"Typically, berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet, sour or tart, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present."
"Common examples are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, red currants, white currants and blackcurrants."
"In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.In common usage, the term ""berry"" differs from the scientific or botanical definition of a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp)."
"The botanical definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known or referred to as berries, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bananas, and chili peppers."
"Fruits commonly considered berries but excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits and mulberries, which are multiple fruits."
"Watermelons and pumpkins are giant berries that fall into the category ""pepos""."
A plant bearing berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate.
"Berries are eaten worldwide and often used in jams, preserves, cakes, or pies."
Some berries are commercially important.
The berry industry varies from country to country as do types of berries cultivated or growing in the wild.
"Some berries such as raspberries and strawberries have been bred for hundreds of years and are distinct from their wild counterparts, while other berries, such as lingonberries and cloudberries, grow almost exclusively in the wild."
"While many berries are edible, some are poisonous to humans, such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed."
"Others, such as the white mulberry, red mulberry, and elderberry, are poisonous when unripe, but are edible when ripe."
"Manchester United Football Club is an English football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester."
"The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR Football Club, the works team of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot in Newton Heath, in 1878."
"The club split from the railway company in 1892 and remained under private ownership for almost 100 years, changing its name to Manchester United after being saved from bankruptcy in 1902."
"The club was the subject of takeover bids from media tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1984 and property trader Michael Knighton in 1989, before going public in 1991; they received another takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB corporation in 1998 before Malcolm Glazer's stake was announced in September 2003."
"By the end of 2003, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004."
"His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid."
"A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing a squeeze-out of the remaining 2%."
The final purchase price of the club totalled almost £800 million.
"Most of the capital used by Glazer to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60 million per annum."
"The remainder came in the form of PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds."
"Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club)."
The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum.
"Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club."
"In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500 million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207 million."
The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means.
"In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Some Manchester United fans opposed Glazer's takeover of the club, particularly once they realised the level of debt that the club would have to take on after having been debt-free for so many years."
Disgruntled fans launched the football club F.C.
"United of Manchester in 2005, which entered the North West Counties Football League and played in the sixth tier National League North from 2015 to 2019."
"Since 2005, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust has been working on a way of returning ownership of the club to supporters; in 2010, they met with a group of wealthy Manchester United fans – dubbed the ""Red Knights"" – to discuss a billion-pound takeover bid."
"However, the bid fell through when the Red Knights refused to meet the Glazers' valuation of the club."
"Kangaroo rats, small mostly nocturnal rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to arid areas of western North America."
The common name derives from their bipedal form.
"They hop in a manner similar to the much larger kangaroo, but developed this mode of locomotion independently, like several other clades of rodents (e.g."
dipodids and hopping mice).
"A harbor (American English), harbour (British English; see spelling differences), or haven is a sheltered body of water where ships, boats, and barges can be docked."
"The term harbor is often used interchangeably with port, which is a man-made facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers."
Ports usually include one or more harbors.
Alexandria Port in Egypt is an example of a port with two harbors.
Harbors may be natural or artificial.
"An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed breakwaters, sea walls, or jettys or they can be constructed by dredging, which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging."
"An example of an artificial harbor is Long Beach Harbor, California, United States, which was an array of salt marshes and tidal flats too shallow for modern merchant ships before it was first dredged in the early 20th century."
"In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by prominences of land."
"Examples of natural harbors include Sydney Harbour, Australia and Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka."
"Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk."
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.
"Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat."
"As of August 2021, 49,623 spider species in 129 families have been recorded by taxonomists."
"However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, however, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax."
"Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen.Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae."
"In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax."
"Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure."
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands.
"Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used."
"It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders."
"Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago, but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets."
"True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago, and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae."
"The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before 200 million years ago."
"The species Bagheera kiplingi was described as herbivorous in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards."
It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year.
"Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down."
"Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones."
"Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, so they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes."
"They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have."
"To avoid being eaten by the females, which are typically much larger, male spiders identify themselves to potential mates by a variety of complex courtship rituals."
"Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans."
"Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs."
"Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them."
"A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals."
"Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing."
"Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity."
"While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides."
"Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories."
"As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers."
An irrational fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.
"Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, photographic, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information."
"The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organisation, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work.The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created."
"Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods."
There are various editorial positions in publishing.
"Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors."
Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release.
"The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap."
"The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor."
A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor.
"Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features."
"In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor."
"In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor)."
Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an acquisitions editor or a commissioning editor in a publishing house.
Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.
"Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style."
"Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors.At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste."
"In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion."
"At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor."
They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer.
These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.
"Lizards (suborder Lacertilia) are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains."
The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards.
Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.
"Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion."
"Some lineages (known as ""legless lizards""), have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies."
Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide.
"They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals."
"Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo."
"Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails."
Chess is a board game played between two players.
"It is sometimes called Western chess, or International chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi."
"The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin."
"Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide."
Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
"At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns."
"The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ""check"") and there is no way for it to escape."
There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
Organized chess arose in the 19th century.
Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation).
"The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion."
A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
"Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology."
One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.
"In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov."
"Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory."
"A lifeboat or liferaft is a small, rigid or inflatable boat carried for emergency evacuation in the event of a disaster aboard a ship."
Lifeboat drills are required by law on larger commercial ships.
Rafts  (liferafts) are also used.
"In the military, a lifeboat may double as a whaleboat, dinghy, or gig."
The ship's tenders of cruise ships often double as lifeboats.
"Recreational sailors usually carry inflatable liferafts, though a few prefer small proactive lifeboats that are harder to sink and can be sailed to safety."
Inflatable lifeboats may be equipped with auto-inflation (carbon dioxide or nitrogen) canisters or mechanical pumps.
"A quick release and pressure release mechanism is fitted on ships so that the canister or pump automatically inflates the lifeboat, and the lifeboat breaks free of the sinking vessel."
Commercial aircraft are also required to carry auto-inflating liferafts in case of an emergency water landing; offshore oil platforms also have liferafts.
"Ship-launched lifeboats are lowered from davits on a ship's deck, and are hard to sink in normal circumstances."
"The cover serves as protection from sun, wind and rain, can be used to collect rainwater, and is normally made of a reflective or fluorescent material that is highly visible."
"Lifeboats have oars, flares and mirrors for signaling, first aid supplies, and food and water for several days."
"Some lifeboats are more capably equipped to permit self-rescue, with supplies such as a radio, an engine and sail, heater, navigational equipment, solar water stills, rainwater catchments and fishing equipment."
The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Life-Saving Appliance Code (LSA) requires certain emergency equipment be carried on each lifeboat and liferaft used on international voyages.
Modern lifeboats carry an Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and either a radar reflector or Search and Rescue Transponder (SART).
"Feces (or faeces) is the solid or semi-solid remains of food that was not digested in the small intestine, and has been broken down by bacteria in the large intestine."
"Feces contains a relatively small amount of metabolic waste products such as bacterially altered bilirubin, and dead epithelial cells from the lining of the gut.Feces is discharged through the anus or cloaca during defecation."
Feces can be used as fertilizer or soil conditioner in agriculture.
It can also be burned as fuel or dried and used for construction.
Some medicinal uses have been found.
"In the case of human feces, fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy are in use."
Urine and feces together are called excreta.
A brake is a mechanical device that inhibits motion by absorbing energy from a moving system.
"It is used for slowing or stopping a moving vehicle, wheel, axle, or to prevent its motion, most often accomplished by means of friction."
"Dirt  is an unclean matter, especially when in contact with a person's clothes, skin, or possessions."
"In such cases, they are said to become dirty."
"Common types of dirt include:

Dust: a general powder of organic or mineral matter
Filth: foul matter such as excrement
Grime: a black, ingrained dust such as soot
Soil: the mix of clay, sand, and humus which lies on top of bedrock."
The term 'soil' may be used to refer to unwanted substances or dirt that are deposited onto surfaces such as clothing.
Knight-service was a form of feudal land tenure under which a knight held a fief or estate of land termed a knight's fee (fee being synonymous with fief) from an overlord conditional on him as tenant performing military service for his overlord.
A firstborn (also known as an eldest child or sometimes firstling) is the first child born to in the birth order of a couple through childbirth.
"Historically, the role of the firstborn child has been socially significant, particularly for a firstborn son in patriarchal societies."
"In law, many systems have incorporated the concept of primogeniture, wherein the firstborn child inherits their parent's property."
"The firstborn in Judaism, the bechor, is also accorded a special position."
"While an only child will by definition also always be the ""firstborn"", in larger families the firstborn often perceives himself or herself to be treated differently from later children."
Huger is a surname of French origin.
"It may refer to:

Five brothers from a prominent South Carolina family of Huguenot descent who served in the American Revolution:

"Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series mainly adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga series, with exactly 500 episodes."
"It is set two and a half years after the original series in the Naruto universe, following the ninja teenager Naruto Uzumaki and his allies."
"The series is directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Pierrot and TV Tokyo."
"It began broadcasting on February 15, 2007 on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.On January 2, 2009, Viz Media and Crunchyroll provided eight uncut English subtitled Naruto: Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website."
"Later on January 15, Viz began providing subtitled versions of the latest Naruto: Shippuden episodes a week after they first aired in Japan, with a new episode being added to the Naruto website each subsequent Thursday."
"The English dub of Naruto: Shippuden made its US premiere on Disney XD on October 28, 2009."
"On July 24, 2009, Viz Media announced that the series would be released on the iTunes Store."
"The first DVD release of the series in North America was released on September 29, 2009.Naruto: Shippuden stopped airing on Disney XD on November 5, 2011 after 98 episodes, in which the network cited more frequent violence that was shown in later episodes."
DVD box sets generally containing thirteen dubbed episodes from episode 1 onward were released quarterly in their uncut format.
"The English dub was streamed on the Neon Alley web channel from its launch in October 2012, and beginning December 29, 2012 with episode 99, dubbed episodes premiered every week uncut until March 25, 2016 after 338 episodes, about a month before Neon Alley's closure."
"Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing the anime from the beginning on January 5, 2014 in an uncut format and as of 2021 it is still running on a weekly basis."
The network started showing never before aired dubbed episodes at the 339th episode mark by May 2021.
"In four regions, episodes from the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray by single volumes and box sets."
"In North America, twelve single volumes and thirty eight box sets have been released."
"In the United Kingdom, twenty eight single volumes and six box sets have been released."
"In Japan, twenty six sets of volumes have been released based on which arc it represents."
"In Australia and New Zealand, twenty-eight collections have been released."
"A puppet is an object, often resembling a human, animal or mythical figure, that is animated or manipulated by a person called a puppeteer."
"The puppeteer uses movements of their hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet."
"The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part."
"The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling."
Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece.
"There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use."
They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex.
"Two simple types of puppets are the finger puppet, which is a tiny puppet that fits onto a single finger, and the sock puppet, which is formed and operated by inserting one's hand inside a sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's ""mouth."""
"The sock puppet is a type of hand puppet, which is controlled using one hand that occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around."
"A ""live-hand puppet"" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet."
"A Marionette is a much more complicated type of puppet that is suspended and controlled by a number of strings connected to the head, back and limbs, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer."
A rod puppet is constructed around a central rod secured to the head.
A shadow puppet is a cut-out figure held between a source of light and a translucent screen.
Bunraku puppets are a type of Japanese wood-carved puppet.
"A ventriloquist's dummy is a puppet, often human-shaped, operated by a ventriloquist performer's hand; the performer produces the puppet's voice with little or no movement of her mouth, which creates the illusion that the puppet is alive."
"Carnival puppets are large puppets, typically bigger than a human, designed to be part of a large spectacle or parade."
Protection is any measure taken to guard a thing against damage caused by outside forces.
"Protection can be provided to physical objects, including organisms, to systems, and to intangible things like civil and political rights."
"Although the mechanisms for providing protection vary widely, the basic meaning of the term remains the same."
"This is illustrated by an explanation found in a manual on electrical wiring:

The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use."
People protect themselves against personal or financial loss by means of insurance and from injury or discomfort by the use of protective clothing.
They further protect their property by the installation of security measures such as locks and/or alarm systems.
"Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light."
"Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss."
"Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations."
Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm.
Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements.
"Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators."
"In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems."
"Humans seek to protect locations of historical and cultural significance through historic preservation efforts, and are also concerned with protecting the environment from damage caused by human activity, and with protecting the Earth as a whole from potentially harmful objects from space."
Heads of state throughout the world and at all periods of history may be ranked according to characteristics such as length of time holding that position; age of accession or death; or physical attributes.
"In this way world records in these characteristics may be identified, although the historical basis for such claims is frequently uncertain."
"A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals."
"In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards."
"Some women with hirsutism, a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard."
"Throughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's fashion trends."
Some religions (such as Islam and Sikhism) have considered a full beard to be essential and mandate it as part of their observance.
"Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's virility, exemplifying such virtues as wisdom, strength, sexual prowess and high social status."
"In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor."
"In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements."
"Mammillaria pottsii, also known as fox-tail cactus or rat-tail nipple cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae."
"It was first described by Scheer ex Salm-Dyck, Cact."
Hort.
"1849: 104 (1850) According to the United Nations Environment Programme, M. leona is a synonym for M. pottsii."
"Rhododendron menziesii, also classified as Menziesia ferruginea, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, known by several common names, including rusty menziesia, false huckleberry, fool's huckleberry and mock azalea."
"Ricardo Valdez Valentine Jr. (born June 24, 1992), known professionally as 6lack (stylized as 6LACK, pronounced ""black""), is an American singer and songwriter."
"He initially gained notable recognition following the release of his single, ""Prblms"", taken from his debut album, Free 6lack, which was released in November 2016."
"He released his second album, East Atlanta Love Letter in September 2018, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart."
"Later that year, he released the single ""OTW"" (with Khalid and Ty Dolla Sign)."
"6lack was featured on the Normani single ""Waves"", which earned him a MTV Video Music Award."
"In June 2020, he released the EP 6pc Hot, which included the single, ""Know My Rights"" (featuring Lil Baby)."
"Later that year he was featured on the Gorillaz track ""The Pink Phantom"", with Sir Elton John."
"In 2021, his single ""Calling My Phone"" (featuring Lil Tjay), topped the charts in Canada, and peaked at number three in the US."
6lack is currently signed to Love Renaissance and Interscope Records.
"He is also a member of the Atlanta-Baltimore music collective Spillage Village, founded by EarthGang and JID."
6lack has received three Grammy Award nominations and has won an MTV Video Music Award.
A process is a series or set of activities that interact to produce a result; it may occur once-only or be recurrent or periodic.
Things called a process include:
"A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction."
"Often a lieutenant governor is the deputy, or lieutenant, to or ranked under a governor — a ""second-in-command"", rather like deputy governor."
"In Canadian provinces or in the Dutch Caribbean, the lieutenant governor is the representative of the monarch in that jurisdiction.In India, lieutenant governors are in charge of special administrative divisions in that country.In the United States, lieutenant governors are usually second-in-command to a state governor, and the actual power held by the lieutenant governor varies greatly from state to state."
"The lieutenant governor is often first in line of succession to the governorship, and acts as governor when the governor leaves the state or is unable to serve."
"Also, the lieutenant governor is often the president of the state senate."
"Clayton ""Peg Leg"" Bates (October 11, 1907 – December 6, 1998) was an African-American entertainer from Fountain Inn, South Carolina, United States."
"The ease of doing business index was an index created jointly by Simeon Djankov, Michael Klein, and Caralee McLiesh, three leading economists at the World Bank Group."
"The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Edward Glaeser, Oliver Hart, and Andrei Shleifer."
"Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicated better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights."
Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong.
"Though the first report was authored by Djankov, Klein, and McLiesh, and they continue to be listed as ""founders"" of the report, some sources attribute the genesis of the idea to Djankov and Gerhard Pohl."
"The report was discontinued by the World Bank on September 16, 2021, following the release of an independent audit of the data irregularities."
The audit documented how bank leadership pressured experts to manipulate the results of the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business Reports.
"Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing."
"From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water."
"The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended."
"In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss."
"This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting.In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal."
"Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics."
Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring.
"The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand."
"Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass."
"The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology."
"Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material."
"Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures."
"Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria."
"The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience."
"Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses."
"In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles."
Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass.
"The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials."
"Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass)."
Claytonia perfoliata (syn.
"Montia perfoliata), also known as miner's lettuce, Indian lettuce, spring beauty, winter purslane, or palsingat, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae."
"It is a fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America, from southernmost Alaska and central British Columbia, all the way south to Central America, but most common in California in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin Valleys."
"Together with Claytonia parviflora and C. rubra, C. perfoliata comprises what is almost certainly a polyploid pillar complex, which is based on three diploid species."
Two key studies on the population ecology and genetics of the C. perfoliata complex were published in 2012.
"A laborer is a person who works in manual labor types, especially in the construction and factory industries' workforce."
"Laborers are in a class of wage-earners in which their only possession of significant material value is their labor, this is the proletariat."
"Industries employing laborers include building things such as roads, buildings, bridges, tunnels, and railway tracks."
"Laborers work with blasting tools, hand tools, power tools, air tools, and small heavy equipment, and act as assistants to other trades as well  such as operators or cement masons."
The 1st century BC engineer Vitruvius writes that a good crew of laborers is just as valuable as any other aspect of construction.
"Other than the addition of pneumatics, laborer practices have changed little."
"With the introduction of field technologies, the laborers have been quick to adapt to the use of this technology as being laborers' work."
"""The Walk In"" is the third episode of the second season of the American television drama series The Americans, and the 16th overall episode of the series."
"It originally aired on FX in the United States on March 12, 2014."
A bedroom is a room situated within a residential or accommodation unit characterised by its usage for sleeping.
"A typical western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture one or two beds (ranging from a crib for an infant, a single or twin bed for a toddler, child, teenager, or single adult to bigger sizes like a full, double, queen, king or California king [eastern or waterbed size for a couple]), a clothes closet, and bedside table and dressing table, both of which usually contain drawers."
"Except in bungalows, ranch style homes, or one-storey motels, bedrooms are usually on one of the floors of a dwelling that is above ground level."
"A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization."
A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard.
"The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command."
"Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company."
Members of a crew are often referred to by the title Crewman.
"Crew also refers to the sport of rowing, where teams row competitively in racing shells."
A daughter is a female offspring; a girl or woman in relation to her parents.
Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter.
The male counterpart is a son.
Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements.
"From biological perspective, a daughter is a first degree relative."
"The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity."
It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.
"In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons."
A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide.
"In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price."
"The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman and is known as a dowry."
The payment of a dowry can be found in societies where women do not labour outside the home.
The Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer introduced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Vantage (1993).
"The first-generation of the ""V12 Vanquish,"" designed by Ian Callum and unveiled at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, was produced from 2001 to 2007 as the flagship of the marque."
"The concept car, known as ""Project Vantage"" and the first Aston Martin design wholly styled by Callum, was built by the Ford Motor Company with craftsman Dilip Chhabria to display the company's vision for a future sports car to represent Aston Martin after the discontinuation of the Virage-based Vantage."
"The V12 Vanquish closely resembled the concept car, and featured carbon fibre and alloy construction, Aston Martin's most powerful V12 engine, and host of new technologies."
A specially modified V12 Vanquish was driven by James Bond in the 2002 film Die Another Day.
"In 2004, a mildly updated version of the first-generation model named ""V12 Vanquish S"" was introduced featuring a more highly tuned engine and more track-oriented ride and handling."
The V12 Vanquish was indirectly replaced by the DBS after 2007.
"The second-generation Vanquish was introduced in 2012, based on the Aston Martin's VH platform, followed in 2017 by a ""Vanquish S"" with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics."
The second-generation Vanquish was succeeded by the DBS Superleggera in 2018.
"A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, cat box, litter tray, cat pan, or litter pan, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats, as well as rabbits, ferrets, miniature pigs, small dogs, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository."
They are provided for pets that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to excrete their metabolic waste.
"Many owners of these animals prefer not to let them roam outside for fear that they might succumb to outdoor dangers, whilst others prevent outdoor visits in order to avoid the potentially negative effect on local wildlife of cats."
"On average, indoor cats have a lifespan of 16.8 years while outdoor cats' lives are much shorter, only 5.6 years."
"These outdoor dangers include weather, wildlife, traffic or diseases such as the feline immunodeficiency virus.In the wild, cats naturally excrete in soft or sandy soil for easy burial."
They use their paws in a backward sweeping motion to cover their feces.
"To stimulate this instinctive desire, a litter box's bottom is typically filled with 2 inches (5 cm) or less of cat litter."
"Litter box filler is a loose, granular material that absorbs moisture and odors such as ammonia."
"Some litter brands contain baking soda to absorb such odors, or owners may sprinkle a thin layer in the bottom of the box, under the cat litter."
The litter material also satisfies a cat's instinctive desire to hide their scent by allowing them to bury their waste.
"The most common material is clay, although recycled paper ""pellets"" and silica-based ""crystal"" variants are also used."
"Sometimes, when an owner wishes to stimulate the cat's natural instincts, natural dirt is used."
"The cat-box that the litter is poured into can give off a strong odor, if not disposed of properly."
"It is recommended that the litter box be kept in low traffic areas of the home, such as a basement or laundry room to avoid litter box aversion."
There are commercially available special types of litter to help cover or lessen the odor produced.
"They contain baking soda, plant extracts and/or odorized crystals."
"If kept in a room with an intake vent, an air freshener may be added on the furnace filter to isolate the odor from the rest of the house."
"Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)."
"It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients."
"Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure."
A number of natural states of water exist.
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog.
"Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state."
"When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow."
The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
"Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans."
"Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)."
"Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea."
Water plays an important role in the world economy.
Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.
Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.
"Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals."
"Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes."
"Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing."
"Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing."
A pocket is a bag- or envelope-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing to hold small items.
"Pockets are also  attached to luggage, backpacks, and similar items."
"In older usage, a pocket was a separate small bag or pouch."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"A funeral director, also known as an undertaker (British English) or mortician (American English), is a professional involved in the business of funeral rites."
"These tasks often entail the embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the arrangements for the funeral ceremony (although not the directing and conducting of the funeral itself unless clergy are not present)."
"Funeral directors may at times be asked to perform tasks such as dressing (in garments usually suitable for daily wear), casketing (placing the corpse in the coffin), and cossetting (applying any sort of cosmetic or substance to the best viewable areas of the corpse for the purpose of enhancing its appearance)."
A funeral director may work at a funeral home or be an independent employee.
The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs.
The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine.
There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different.
Most gym and weight rooms will have the machine in their facility.
"The leg extension is an isolated exercise targeting one specific muscle group, the quadriceps."
"It should not be considered as a total leg workout, such as the squat or deadlift."
"The exercise consists of bending the leg at the knee and extending the legs, then lowering them back to the original position."
"Primitive Baptists – also known as Hard Shell Baptists, Foot Washing Baptists or Old School Baptists – are conservative Baptists adhering to a degree of Calvinist beliefs who coalesced out of the controversy among Baptists in the early 19th century over the appropriateness of mission boards, tract societies, and temperance societies."
"The adjective ""primitive"" in the name is used in the sense of ""original""."
The facial artery (external maxillary artery in older texts) is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies structures of the superficial face.
"A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats."
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
"Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures."
"Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball."
"Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities."
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
"The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers."
"In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit."
"Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g."
rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger.
"Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months."
"There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill."
"The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), also called the varying hare or snowshoe rabbit, is a species of hare found in North America."
"It has the name ""snowshoe"" because of the large size of its hind feet."
The animal's feet prevent it from sinking into the snow when it hops and walks.
Its feet also have fur on the soles to protect it from freezing temperatures.
"For camouflage, its fur turns white during the winter and rusty brown during the summer."
Its flanks are white year-round.
The snowshoe hare is also distinguishable by the black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears.
Its ears are shorter than those of most other hares.
"In summer, it feeds on plants such as grass, ferns, and leaves; in winter, it eats twigs, the bark from trees, and plants and, similar to the Arctic hare, has been known to occasionally eat dead animals."
It can sometimes be seen feeding in small groups.
This animal is mainly active at night and does not hibernate.
"The snowshoe hare may have up to four litters in a year, which average three to eight young."
"Males compete for females, and females may breed with several males."
A major predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx.
"Historical records of animals caught by fur hunters over hundreds of years show the lynx and hare numbers rising and falling in a cycle, which has made the hare known to biology students worldwide as a case study of the relationship between numbers of predators and their prey."
"In vertebrate anatomy, ribs (Latin: costae) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage, part of the axial skeleton."
"In most tetrapods, ribs surround the chest, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the chest cavity."
"They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other internal organs of the thorax."
"In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body."
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
"As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape."
"A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds."
"Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container."
"Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed."
"Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density."
"A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena."
"Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth."
"The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas."
"Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter."
"On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids."
"Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist."
Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma from within stars.
"A noise barrier (also called a soundwall, noise wall, sound berm, sound barrier, or acoustical barrier) is an exterior structure designed to protect inhabitants of sensitive land use areas from noise pollution."
"Noise barriers are the most effective method of mitigating roadway, railway, and industrial noise sources – 
other than cessation of the source activity or use of source controls."
"In the case of surface transportation noise, other methods of reducing the source noise intensity include encouraging the use of hybrid and electric vehicles, improving automobile aerodynamics and tire design, and choosing low-noise paving material."
Extensive use of noise barriers began in the United States after noise regulations were introduced in the early 1970s.
"A sidewalk (North American English), pavement (British English), footpath (Oceanian English), or footway, is a path along the side of a road."
"Usually constructed of concrete or asphalt, it is designed for pedestrians."
"A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb (spelled ""kerb"" outside North America)."
"There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the sidewalk and the roadway or between the sidewalk and the boundary."
"In some places, the same term may also be used for a paved path, trail or footpath that is not next to a road, for example, a path through a park."
A candlestick is a device used to hold a candle in place.
"Candlesticks have a cup or a spike (""pricket"") or both to keep the candle in place."
"Candlesticks are less frequently called ""candleholders""."
"Before the proliferation of electricity, candles were carried between rooms using a chamberstick, a short candlestick with a pan to catch dripping wax.Although electric lighting has phased out candles in much of the world, candlesticks and candelabras are still used in homes as decorative elements or to add atmosphere on special occasions."
"Rhode Island ( (listen), like road), officially the State of Rhode Island, is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States."
"It is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly fewer than 1.1 million residents as of 2020, but it is the second-most densely populated after New Jersey."
"It takes its name from the eponymous island, though most of its land area is on the mainland."
"Rhode Island borders Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; it also shares a small maritime border with New York."
Providence is its capital and most populous city.
Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century.
"Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies for being founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty."
"He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government."
"The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker ""Rogue's Island"".Reflecting its status as a hub of relative tolerance and free thought, Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress in 1774 and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776."
"After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 9, 1778."
"Favoring a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution, which it initially refused to ratify; it was the last of the original 13 states to do so, on May 29, 1790.Formerly named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era, in November 2020 the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping ""and Providence Plantations"" from its full name."
"Its official nickname is the ""Ocean State"", a reference to its 400 miles (640 km) of coastline and the large bays and inlets that comprise about 14% of its total area."
"An instrumental is a recording normally without any vocals, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a big band setting."
"Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word song may refer to instrumentals."
The music is primarily or exclusively produced using musical instruments.
"An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer themselves will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in components from a duo or trio to a large big band, concert band or orchestra."
"In a song that is otherwise sung, a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an instrumental interlude, or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental introduction."
"If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a ""solo"" (e.g., the guitar solo that is a key section of heavy metal music and hard rock songs)."
"If the instruments are percussion instruments, the interlude can be called a percussion interlude or ""percussion break""."
These interludes are a form of break in the song.
City limits or city boundaries refer to the defined boundary or border of a city.
The area within the city limit can be called the city proper.
Town limit/boundary and village limit/boundary apply to towns and villages.
"Similarly, corporate limit is a legal name that refers to the boundary of municipal corporations."
"In some countries, the limit of a municipality may be expanded through annexation."
Guardsman is a rank used instead of private in some military units that serve as the official bodyguard of a sovereign or head of state.
It is also used as a generic term for any member of a guards unit of any rank.
"A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling."
The female counterpart is a sister.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full brother is a first degree relative.
"Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television."
"Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.The term ""drama"" comes from a Greek word ""draō"" meaning ""to do / to act"" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from ""I do"" (Classical Greek: δράω, drao)."
The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy.
"In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game (translating the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre.The use of ""drama"" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era."
"""Drama"" in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887)."
"It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe ""drama"" as a genre within their respective media."
The term ”radio drama“ has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance.
"May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception."
"The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body."
"Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance ""expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action""."
"Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example)."
"Closet drama is a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed."
"In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience."
"A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, and set apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake."
"Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they do form part of the Earth's water cycle."
"Lakes are distinct from lagoons, which are generally coastal parts of the ocean."
"Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or scientific definitions."
"Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which usually flow in a channel on land."
"Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation."
"Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened into a basin."
Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.
"All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them."
"Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, for aesthetic or recreational purposes, or for other activities."
"A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time."
"Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements."
Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area.
"A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy."
"Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances."
The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in hobbies.
"Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time."
"Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally project-based leisure which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding."
"Ecballium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae containing a single species, Ecballium elaterium, also called the squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber (not the same plant as Cyclanthera brachystachya)."
"Its unusual common name derives from the ripe fruit squirting a stream of mucilaginous liquid containing its seeds as a means of seed dispersal, an example of rapid plant movement."
An observation tower is a structure used to view events from a long distance and to create a full 360 degree range of vision to conduct long distance observations.
"Observation towers are usually at least 20 metres (66 ft) tall and are made from stone, iron, and wood."
"Many modern towers are also used as TV towers, restaurants, or churches."
"The towers first appeared in the ancient world, as long ago as the Babylonian Empire."
Observation towers that are used as guard posts or observation posts over an extended period to overlook an area are commonly called watchtowers instead.
"Wilderness or wildlands (usually in the plural), are natural environments on Earth that have not been significantly modified by human activity or any nonurbanized land not under extensive agricultural cultivation."
"The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness."
"Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity."
"Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity.Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development."
"These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas."
"Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation."
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories."
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
"Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals."
"The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth."
"Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts."
Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
"Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture."
"As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography."
"Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes."
"As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems."
"This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.
"The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food."
"The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the ""right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food"", as well as the ""fundamental right to be free from hunger""."
"Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 ""Zero hunger"" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030."
"Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
"An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves."
"Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities."
"The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period."
The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
"At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground."
"When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami."
"Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and, occasionally, volcanic activity."
"In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves."
"Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests."
An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus.
The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.
A financial adviser or financial advisor is a professional who provides financial services to clients based on their financial situation.
"In many countries, financial advisors must complete specific training and be registered with a regulatory body in order to provide advice."
"In the United States, a financial adviser carries a Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65 qualification examination."
"According to the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), qualification designations and compliance issues must be reported for public view."
"FINRA specifies the following groups who may use the term financial advisor: brokers, investment advisers, private bankers, accountants, lawyers, insurance agents and financial planners."
"In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of all of the shares into which ownership of a corporation or company is divided."
"(Especially in American English, the word ""stocks"" is also used to refer to shares.)"
A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares.
"This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested."
"Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders."
"Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy."
The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account.
"As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business."
"Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price."
"Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price."
"This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."
Stocks are a function of capitalism and therefore the stock market operates by the price mechanism a stock cannot be classified as an investment unless it pays a dividend (the standard dividend yield is 2%) otherwise it must be classified as a speculation (gambling).
However if you decide to reinvest the dividends it is not speculation and assuming for ceteris paribus this will lead to an exponential growth of FV = P*(1+r/m)*m*t. Where P is the initial investment.
R is the yield.
M is dividends per year.
And t is number of years.
A dividend king is a stock which has had an increasing or constant dividend yield for over 50 successive years.
The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom.
"British scientific intelligence at the Air Ministry fought back with a variety of their own increasingly effective means, involving jamming and deception signals."
"The period ended when the Wehrmacht moved their forces to the East in May 1941, in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union.The idea of ""beam"" based navigation was developed during the 1930s, initially as a blind landing aid."
The basic concept is to produce two directional radio signals that are aimed slightly to the left and right of a runway's midline.
Radio operators in the aircraft listen for these signals and determine which of the two beams they are flying in.
"This is normally accomplished by sending Morse code signals into the two beams, to identify right and left."
"For bombing, the Luftwaffe built huge versions of the antennas to provide much greater accuracy at long range, named Knickebein and X-Gerät."
"These were used during the early stages of ""The Blitz"" with great effect, in one case laying a strip of bombs down the centerline of a factory deep in England."
"Tipped off about the system's operation by pre-war military intelligence, the British responded by sending their own Morse code signals so that the aircraft believed they were always properly centred in the beam while they flew wildly off course."
The Germans became convinced the British had somehow learned to bend radio signals.
"When the problem became widespread, the Germans introduced a new system that worked on different principles, the Y-Gerät."
"Having guessed the nature of this system from a passing mention, the British had already deployed countermeasures that rendered the system useless almost as soon as it was used."
"The Germans eventually gave up on the entire concept of radio navigation over the UK, concluding the British would continue to successfully jam it."
A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor.
"A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale."
"Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol."
"A chisel is a tool with a characteristically shaped cutting edge (such that wood chisels have lent part of their name to a particular grind) of blade on its end, for carving or cutting a hard material such as wood, stone, or metal by hand, struck with a mallet, or  mechanical power."
The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or of wood with a sharp edge in it.
Chiselling use involves forcing the blade into some material to cut it.
"The driving force may be applied by pushing by hand, or by using a mallet or hammer."
"In industrial use, a hydraulic ram or falling weight ('trip hammer') may be used to drive a chisel into the material."
"A gouge (one type of chisel) serves to carve small pieces from the material, particularly in woodworking, woodturning and sculpture."
Gouges  most frequently produce concave surfaces.
A gouge typically has a 'U'-shaped cross-section.
"A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred."
"The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, ""sleeping place"") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs."
"The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an ""above-ground grave"" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice."
"In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries."
These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs.
"Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled."
"""Circle of Life"" is a song from The Walt Disney Company 1994 animated film The Lion King."
"Composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice, the song was performed by Carmen Twillie (the deep female lead vocals) and Lebo M. (opening vocals in Zulu) as the film's opening song."
"In an interview, Rice said he was amazed at the speed with which John composed: ""I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon."
"By half-past three, he'd finished writing and recording a stunning demo."""
"Elton John sang a pop version (with alternative lyrics) of the song with the London Community Gospel Choir, which was included in the film's soundtrack and made into a music video."
"""Circle of Life"" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1994, along with two other songs from The Lion King: ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the latter of which won the award."
"""Circle of Life"" was also nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy."
The song reached No.
11 in the UK and No.
"18 in the US and is featured frequently in attractions based on The Lion King, such as Disney theme parks and parades."
Michael Crawford sang it as part of a medley for The Disney Album in 2001.
"The song was featured in Disney's 2019 photorealistic computer-animated remake of The Lion King and was used in the first trailer of the film, a near shot-for-shot remake of the opening of the original animated film."
"This new version of the song was performed by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the actress who performed as Rafiki in the stage adaptation of the movie in London from 2005 to 2018."
"However, the new version also retains the original Zulu opening vocals by Lebo M. from the 1994 film."
A road is a linear way for the conveyance of traffic that typically has an improved surface for use by vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) and pedestrians.
"Unlike streets, the primary function of roads is transportation."
"There are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and local roads."
"The primary features of roads include lanes, sidewalks (pavement), roadways (carriageways), medians, shoulders, verges, bike paths (cycle paths), and shared-use paths."
"A given name (also known as a first name or forename) is the part of a personal name that identifies a person, potentially with a middle name as well, and differentiates that person from the other members of a group (typically a family or clan) who have a common surname."
"The term given name refers to a name bestowed at or close to the time of birth, usually by the parents of the newborn."
"A Christian name is the first name which is given at baptism, in Christian custom."
"In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner."
"In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used."
"The idioms 'on a first-name basis' and 'being on first-name terms' refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name) is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family."
Regnal names and religious or monastic names are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name.
"Jellyfish and sea jellies are the informal common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, a major part of the phylum Cnidaria."
"Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile."
The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for highly efficient locomotion.
The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators.
"Jellyfish have a complex life cycle; the medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula larva that disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase before reaching sexual maturity."
"Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea."
"Scyphozoans (the ""true jellyfish"") are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater."
"Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide."
"The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature within a few months then die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived."
"Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures."
"They are considered a delicacy in some Asian countries, where species in the Rhizostomae order are pressed and salted to remove excess water."
"Australian researchers have described them as a ""perfect food"", sustainable, and protein-rich but relatively low in food energy.They are also used in research, where the green fluorescent protein used by some species to cause bioluminescence has been adapted as a fluorescent marker for genes inserted into other cells or organisms."
The stinging cells used by jellyfish to subdue their prey can injure humans.
"Thousands of swimmers worldwide are stung every year, with effects ranging from mild discomfort to serious injury or even death."
"When conditions are favourable, jellyfish can form vast swarms, which can be responsible for damage to fishing gear by filling fishing nets, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea."
"An infant (from the Latin word infans, meaning 'unable to speak' or 'speechless') is the more formal or specialised synonym for the common term baby, meaning the very young offspring of human beings."
The term may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms.
"A newborn is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to one month old."
"In medical contexts, newborn or neonate (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants."
"Before birth, the term fetus is used."
"The term infant is typically applied to very young children under one year of age; however, definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age."
"When a human child learns to walk, the term toddler may be used instead."
"A payment is the voluntary tender of money or its equivalent or of things of value by one party (such as a person or company) to another in exchange for goods, or services provided by them, or to fulfill a legal obligation."
"The party making the payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment."
"Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example:

the use of money, cheque, or debit, credit or bank transfers."
"the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, the exchange of one good or service for another.In general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit."
Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee unless the parties agree otherwise.
Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction.
"The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc."
"On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc."
"Payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follow the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is becoming common for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided."
"In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider."
"In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer’s legal obligations."
The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation.
"A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours."
A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer.
"A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as ""paid in full""."
The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.
"Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food."
The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum).
The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE.
"Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis."
"Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares or 545 million acres, 2014)."
World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.
"In 2017, world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes (1.7 trillion pounds), with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes (1.7 trillion pounds), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize."
"Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century."
"Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates."
"Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids."
"When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.In a small part of the general population, gluten – the major part of wheat protein – can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis."
"In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves."
"In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height."
"In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees."
Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
"Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old."
Trees have been in existence for 370 million years.
It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.
"This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another."
For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
"Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil."
"Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots."
"The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development."
Trees usually reproduce using seeds.
"Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones."
"Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead."
Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate.
They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues.
Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world.
"Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses."
"In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture."
"Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies."
"A suit or lounge suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes."
It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes.
The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing.
"After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit."
A black lounge suit for professional occasions became known as a business suit and belongs to the day dress of the semi-formal wear dress code.Suits are offered in different designs and constructions.
"Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories."
A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat.
Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture.
"Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap."
"Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry."
"Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively."
"Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth."
"These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences."
"Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments."
"Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways:

bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available;
ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required;
suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options"
"A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air."
"Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane."
"The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope."
"As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere."
"The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air."
"In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex."
"Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications."
The hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology.
"The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France, in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers."
"The first hot air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793, by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard."
Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.
"Smoke  is a collection of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass."
"It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.)."
"It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes."
It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.
Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires.
"The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products."
Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.
"A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes."
"Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive."
"Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping."
"The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables."
"Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times."
"The word ""map"" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world."
"Thus, ""map"" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams."
"Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen."
Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands—called coal forests—that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.
"However, many significant coal deposits are younger than this and originate from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras."
Coal is primarily used as a fuel.
"While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited until the Industrial Revolution."
"With the invention of the steam engine, coal consumption increased."
In 2020 coal supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and over a third of  its electricity.
Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal.
The extraction and use of coal causes premature deaths and illness.
"The use of coal damages the environment, and it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change."
"14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted by burning coal in 2020, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and over 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions."
As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have reduced or eliminated their use of coal power.
The UN Secretary General asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020.
Global coal use peaked in 2013.
"To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to below 2 °C (3.6 °F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030, and phasing down coal was agreed in the Glasgow Climate Pact."
The largest consumer and importer of coal in 2020 was China.
"China accounts for almost half the world's annual coal production, followed by India with about a tenth."
"Indonesia and Australia export the most, followed by Russia."
"Placeholder names are words that can refer to things or people whose names do not exist, are temporarily forgotten, are to avoid stigmatization, or unknown in the context in which they are being discussed, or one is unable to or does not care to specify precisely."
"Height is  measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how ""tall"" something or someone is) or vertical position (how ""high"" a point is)."
"For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m""."
"When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude."
"Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation.In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value."
"If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero."
"In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or ""above"") the x-y plane."
Naturism is a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social nudity in private and in public; the word also refers to the cultural movement which advocates and defends that lifestyle.
Both may alternatively be called nudism.
"Though the two terms are broadly interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated."
"That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology."
"Ethical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing."
"At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose."
"Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities."
"Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals through officially designated nude beaches and parks and on to public spaces and buildings in some jurisdictions."
Rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp.
"napus), also known as rape, or oilseed rape, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of erucic acid."
Canola are a group of rapeseed cultivars which were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and are especially prized for use for human and animal food.
Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.
"The Bronx () is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Bronx County, in the U.S. state of New York."
"It is south of Westchester County; north and east of the New York City borough of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of the New York City borough of Queens, across the East River."
"The Bronx has a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,472,654 in the 2020 census."
"If each borough were ranked as a city, the Bronx would rank as the ninth-most-populous in the U.S. Of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest population density."
It is the only borough of New York City not primarily on an island.
"With a population that is 54.8% Hispanic as of 2020, it is the only majority-Hispanic county in the Northeastern United States and the fourth-most-populous nationwide.The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, and a flatter eastern section."
East and west street names are divided by Jerome Avenue.
"The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895."
Bronx County was separated from New York County in 1914.
"About a quarter of the Bronx's area is open space, including Woodlawn Cemetery, Van Cortlandt Park, Pelham Bay Park, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo in the borough's north and center."
The Thain Family Forest at the New York Botanical Garden is thousands of years old; it is New York City's largest remaining tract of the original forest that once covered the city.
These open spaces are primarily on land reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from Manhattan.
"The word ""Bronx"" originated with Faroese-born (or Swedish-born) Jonas Bronck, who established the first settlement in the area as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639."
European settlers displaced the native Lenape after 1643.
"In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant and migrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from European countries (particularly Ireland, Germany, Italy and Eastern Europe) and later from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic), as well as African American migrants from the southern United States.The Bronx contains the poorest congressional district in the United States, the 15th."
"There are, however, some upper-income, as well as middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale, Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Schuylerville, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Morris Park, and Country Club."
"Parts of the Bronx saw a steep decline in population, livable housing, and quality of life in the late 1960s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and into the early 1990s, culminating in a wave of arson in the late 1970s."
"The South Bronx, in particular, experienced severe urban decay."
The borough began experiencing new population growth starting in the late 1990s and continuing to present.
Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence.
"In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups."
"Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties."
"Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity."
"""Psychological peace"" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined, yet often a necessary precursor to establishing ""behavioral peace."""
"Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a ""peaceful inner disposition."""
Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life.
"The acquisition of such a ""peaceful internal disposition"" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests."
"Peace is not often in the state of excitement although we are happy when excited, but peace is when one's mind is quiet and satisfied."
"A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively."
"Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size."
Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.
"In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing."
"Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head."
"The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates."
The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ.
"In the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion, following chewing."
It performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and hydrochloric acid.
"In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine."
The stomach secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion.
"The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines."
Begonia  is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Begoniaceae.
"The genus contains more than 2,000 different plant species."
The Begonias are native to moist subtropical and tropical climates.
Some species are commonly grown indoors as ornamental houseplants in cooler climates.
"In cooler climates some species are cultivated outside in summertime for their bright colorful flowers, which have sepals but no petals."
A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
"A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user."
"The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice."
"A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device."
"This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households."
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
"In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone."
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
"The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker."
"Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously."
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
"Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards."
"These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network."
"For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century."
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
"In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost."
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
"Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs."
"A zipper, zip, fly, or zip fastener, formerly known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag."
"It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans), luggage and other bags, sporting goods, camping gear (e.g."
"tents and sleeping bags), and other items."
"Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colors."
"Whitcomb L. Judson, who was an American inventor from Chicago, is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was used for footwear, not clothing."
"The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth."
"Initially, it was titled the ""hookless fastener"" and was later redesigned to become more reliable."
"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition."
"In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe."
In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.
"In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's  pouch."
It is not only mammals that give birth.
"Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them."
"Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals."
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
Tom Bombadil is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.
"He first appeared in print in a 1934 poem called The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, which also included the Lord of the Rings characters Goldberry (Tom's wife), Old Man Willow (an evil tree in Tom's forest) and the Barrow-wight, from whom Tom rescues the hobbits."
"They were not then explicitly part of the older legends that became The Silmarillion, and are not mentioned in The Hobbit."
"Bombadil is best known from his appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien's high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings, published in 1954 and 1955."
"In the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo Baggins and company meet Bombadil in the Old Forest."
This idea and an appearance by both Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wight were included in some of Tolkien's earliest notes for a sequel to The Hobbit.
"Bombadil is mentioned but not seen near the end of The Return of the King, with Gandalf planning to pay him a long visit."
"Bombadil was omitted from Peter Jackson's film trilogy, the 1978 film and radio adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, as non-essential to the story."
Commentators have debated the role and origins of Tom Bombadil.
"A likely source is the demigod Väinämöinen in the 1849 Finnish epic poem Kalevala, with many points of resemblance."
"Scholars have noted that he is the spirit of a place, a genius loci."
"A pistol is a handgun, more specifically one with the chamber integral to its gun barrel, though in common usage the two terms are often used interchangeably."
The English word was introduced in ca.
1570 – when early handguns were produced in Europe and is derived from the Middle French pistolet (ca.
"1550), meaning a small gun or knife."
"In colloquial usage, the word ""pistol"" is often used to describe any type of handgun, inclusive of revolvers (which have a single barrel and a separate cylinder housing multiple chambers) and the pocket-sized derringers (which are often multi-barrelled)."
"The most common type of pistol used in the contemporary era is the semi-automatic pistol, while the older single-shot and manual repeating pistols are now rarely seen and used primarily for nostalgic hunting and historical reenactment, and the fully automatic machine pistols are uncommon in civilian usage due to generally poor recoil-controllability and strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale."
A dragon is a snake-like legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide.
"Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire."
"Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence."
The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes.
Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature.
Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies.
"Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from Beowulf."
"The popular western image of a dragon is likely based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes."
"In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by saints or culture heroes, as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon."
"They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure."
"These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature, including The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin."
"The word ""dragon"" has also come to be applied to the legendary creature in Chinese mythology, loong (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng), which is associated with good fortune and is thought to have power over rain."
Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of dragon dancing and dragon boat racing.
Many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions.
"Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China, who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles."
"The impression of dragons in a large number of Asian countries has been influenced by Chinese culture, such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan and so on."
"Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the ""Yellow Dragon flag"" of the Qing Dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries."
"The white dragon of the flag of modern Bhutan is a very classic Chinese style dragon.Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth."
"Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery."
"A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution."
"Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage."
Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g.
"Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami)."
"There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: The former, other than February 29, occurs each year (e.g."
"January 15), while the latter is the exact date a person was born (e.g."
"January 15, 2001)."
"Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium."
There are many types of hockey.
"Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not."
"In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word ""hockey"" is often preceded by another word i.e."
"""field hockey"", ""ice hockey"", ""roller hockey"", ""rink hockey"", or ""floor hockey""."
"In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick."
"Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a ""puck"") with a hole in the center instead."
The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks.
The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics.
"The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963."
"Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936."
"In most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.In more recent history, the word ""hockey"" is used in reference to either the summer sport of field hockey, which is a stick and ball game, and the winter ice team skating sports of bandy and ice hockey."
"This is due to the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and their related variants preceded games which would eventually be played on ice with ice skates, namely bandy and ice hockey, as well as sports involving dry floors such as roller hockey and floor hockey."
"However, the ""hockey"" referred to in common parlance often depends on locale, geography, and the size and popularity of the sport involved."
"For example, in Europe, ""hockey"" more typically refers to field hockey, whereas in Canada, it typically refers to ice hockey."
"In the case of bandy, the game was initially called ""hockey on the ice"" and preceded the organization and development of ice hockey, but was officially changed to ""bandy"" in the early 20th century in order to avoid confusion with ice hockey, a separate sport."
"A court is any person or institution, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law."
"In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all people have an ability to bring their claims before a court."
"Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court."
The system of courts that interprets and applies the law is collectively known as the judiciary.
The place where a court sits is known as a venue.
"The room where court proceedings occur is known as a courtroom, and the building as a courthouse; court facilities range from simple and very small facilities in rural communities to large buildings in cities."
"The practical authority given to the court is known as its jurisdiction (from Latin iūrisdictiō, from iūris, ""of the law,"" + dīcō, ""to declare,"" + -tiō, noun-forming suffix), the court's power to decide certain kinds of questions or petitions put to it."
"According to William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, a court (for civil wrongs) is constituted by a minimum of three parties: the āctor or plaintiff, who complains of an injury done; the reus or defendant, who is called upon to make satisfaction for it; and the jūdex or judicial power, who is to examine the truth of the fact, determine the law arising upon that fact, and, if any injury appears to have been done, ascertain and by its officers apply a legal remedy."
"It is also usual in the superior courts to have barristers, and attorneys or counsel, as assistants, though, often, courts consist of additional barristers, bailiffs, reporters, and perhaps a jury."
"The term ""the court"" is also used to refer to the presiding officer or officials, usually one or more judges."
"The judge or panel of judges may also be collectively referred to as ""the bench"" (in contrast to attorneys and barristers, collectively referred to as ""the bar"").In the United States, the legal authority of a court to take action is based on personal jurisdiction over the parties to the litigation and subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims asserted."
"In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc."
"The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed."
"The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and the date of repayment."
"A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower."
The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan.
"In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants."
"Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent."
Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies.
"For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding."
"Polka dot is a pattern consisting of an array of large filled circles of the same size.Polka dots are commonly seen on children's clothing, toys, furniture, ceramics, and Central European folk art but they appear in a wide array of contexts."
"The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as bathing suits and lingerie."
"Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal clothing."
A bank is a financial institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates a demand deposit while simultaneously making loans.
Lending activities can be directly performed by the bank or indirectly through capital markets.
"Because banks play an important role in financial stability and the economy of a country, most jurisdictions exercise a high degree of regulation over banks."
"Most countries have institutionalised a system known as fractional reserve banking, under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities."
"In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, the Basel Accords."
Banking in its modern sense evolved in the fourteenth century in the prosperous cities of Renaissance Italy but in many ways functioned as a continuation of ideas and concepts of credit and lending that had their roots in the ancient world.
"In the history of banking, a number of banking dynasties –  notably, the Medicis, the Fuggers, the Welsers, the Berenbergs, and the Rothschilds –  have played a central role over many centuries."
"The oldest existing retail bank is Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (founded in 1472), while the oldest existing merchant bank is Berenberg Bank (founded in 1590)."
"Tunisia, officially the Republic of Tunisia, is the northernmost country in Africa."
"It is a part of the Maghreb region of North Africa, and is bordered by Algeria to the west and southwest, Libya to the southeast, and the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east; covering 163,610 km2 (63,170 sq mi), with a population of 11 million."
"It contains the eastern end of the Atlas Mountains and the northern reaches of the Sahara desert, with much of its remaining territory arable land."
"Its 1,300 km (810 mi) of coastline include the African conjunction of the western and eastern parts of the Mediterranean Basin."
"Tunisia is home to Africa's northernmost point, Cape Angela; and its capital and largest city is Tunis, located on its northeastern coast, which lends the country its name."
"From early antiquity, Tunisia was inhabited by the indigenous Berbers."
"Phoenicians began to arrive in the 12th century BC, establishing several settlements, of which Carthage emerged as the most powerful by the 7th century BC."
"A major mercantile empire and a military rival of the Roman Republic, Carthage was defeated by the Romans in 146 BC, who occupied Tunisia for most of the next 800 years, introducing Christianity and leaving architectural legacies like the amphitheatre of El Jem."
"After several attempts starting in 647, Muslims conquered all of Tunisia by 697, bringing Islam and Arab culture to the local inhabitants."
"The Ottoman Empire established control in 1574 and held sway for over 300 years, until the French conquered Tunisia in 1881."
"Tunisia gained independence under the leadership of Habib Bourguiba, who declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957."
"Today, Tunisia is the smallest nation in North Africa, and its culture and identity are rooted in this centuries-long intersection of different cultures and ethnicities."
"In 2011, the Tunisian Revolution, triggered by the lack of freedom and democracy under the 24-year rule of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, overthrew his regime and catalyzed the broader Arab Spring across the region."
"Free multiparty parliamentary elections were held shortly after; the country again voted for parliament on 26 October 2014, and for president on 23 November 2014."
"Tunisia remains a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic; and is the only North African country classified as ""Free"" by Freedom House, and considered the only fully democratic state in the Arab World in the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index."
"It is one of the few countries in Africa ranking high in the  Human Development Index, with one of the highest per capita incomes in the continent."
Tunisia is well integrated into the international community.
"It is a member of the United Nations, La Francophonie, the Arab League, the OIC, the African Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the International Criminal Court, and the Group of 77, among others."
"It maintains close economic and political relations with some European countries, particularly with France, and Italy, which geographically lie very close to it."
"Tunisia also has an association agreement with the European Union, and has also attained the status of a major non-NATO ally of the United States."
The goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of order Cypriniformes.
"It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish."
"Goldfish released into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.Native to East Asia, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp)."
"It was first selectively bred for color in imperial China more than 1,000 years ago, and several distinct breeds have since been developed."
"Goldfish breeds vary greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known)."
The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated one-toed hoofed mammal.
It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus.
"The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today."
"Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC."
"Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses."
"These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated."
"There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior."
"Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, possessing an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response."
"Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults."
"Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth."
Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four.
"They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years."
"Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited ""hot bloods"" with speed and endurance; ""cold bloods"", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and ""warmbloods"", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe."
"There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses."
"Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy."
"Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control."
"Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares."
"Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers."
The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
"Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel."
A male that has been castrated is a capon.
An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
"Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)."
Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
"Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011."
There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
"There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature."
"Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent."
"From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC."
"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."
"A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes."
It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis.
"A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
"A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases."
"A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual."
"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources."
"Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet."
"The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example."
"Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning."
"Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet."
Hence managing information in an information world has become very easy simply because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.
"The services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination ""library and information services"", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently."
"A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre; equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane so that its distance from a given point is constant."
The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius.
"Usually, the radius is required to be a positive number (Circle with 
  
    
      
        r
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle r=0}
   is a degenerate case)."
"This article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted."
"Specifically, a circle is a simple closed curve that divides the plane into two regions: an interior and an exterior."
"In everyday use, the term ""circle"" may be used interchangeably to refer to either the boundary of the figure, or to the whole figure including its interior; in strict technical usage, the circle is only the boundary and the whole figure is called a disc."
"A circle may also be defined as a special kind of ellipse in which the two foci are coincident, the eccentricity is 0, and the semi-major and semi-minor axes are equal; or the two-dimensional shape enclosing the most area per unit perimeter squared, using calculus of variations."
The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings.
"It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand."
A plectrum or individual finger picks may be used to strike the strings.
"The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier."
The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points.
"Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut."
Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States; nylon strings came in the 1940s.
"The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument."
There are three main types of modern guitar: the classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar); the steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar; and the Hawaiian guitar (played  across the player's lap).
"Traditional acoustic guitars include the flat top guitar (typically with a large sound hole) or an archtop guitar, which is sometimes called a ""jazz guitar""."
"The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a resonating chamber."
"The classical Spanish guitar is often played as a solo instrument using a comprehensive fingerstyle technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed."
"The term ""finger-picking"" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States."
"Electric guitars, first patented in 1937, use a pickup and amplifier that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing no resonant chamber."
"A wide array of electronic effects units became possible including reverb and distortion (or ""overdrive"")."
Solid-body guitars began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted acoustic feedback.
"As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including hollowbody guitars, archtop guitars (used in jazz guitar, blues and rockabilly) and solid-body guitars, which are widely used in rock music."
"The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp has played a key role in the development of blues and rock music, both as an accompaniment instrument (playing riffs and chords) and performing guitar solos, and in many rock subgenres, notably heavy metal music and punk rock."
The electric guitar has had a major influence on popular culture.
The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide.
"It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as blues, bluegrass, country, flamenco, folk, jazz, jota, mariachi, metal, punk, reggae, rock, soul, and pop."
A kitten is a juvenile cat.
"After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally dependent on their mothers for survival."
They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days.
"After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest."
"After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow baby teeth."
Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.
"In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes both the direction and the steepness of the line."
"Slope is often denoted by the letter m; there is no clear answer to the question why the letter m is used for slope, but its earliest use in English appears in O'Brien (1844) who wrote the equation of a straight line as ""y = mx + b"" and it can also be found in Todhunter (1888) who wrote it as ""y = mx + c"".Slope is calculated by finding the ratio of the ""vertical change"" to the ""horizontal change"" between (any) two distinct points on a line."
"Sometimes the ratio is expressed as a quotient (""rise over run""), giving the same number for every two distinct points on the same line."
"A line that is decreasing has a negative ""rise""."
"The line may be practical - as set by a road surveyor, or in a diagram that models a road or a roof either as a description or as a plan."
"The steepness, incline, or grade of a line is measured by the absolute value of the slope."
A slope with a greater absolute value indicates a steeper line.
"The direction of a line is either increasing, decreasing, horizontal or vertical."
A line is increasing if it goes up from left to right.
"The slope is positive, i.e."
"m
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m>0}
  ."
A line is decreasing if it goes down from left to right.
"The slope is negative, i.e."
"m
        <
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle m<0}
  ."
If a line is horizontal the slope is zero.
This is a constant function.
"If a line is vertical the slope is undefined (see below).The rise of a road between two points is the difference between the altitude of the road at those two points, say y1 and y2, or in other words, the rise is (y2 − y1) = Δy."
"For relatively short distances, where the earth's curvature may be neglected, the run is the difference in distance from a fixed point measured along a level, horizontal line, or in other words, the run is (x2 − x1) = Δx."
Here the slope of the road between the two points is simply described as the ratio of the altitude change to the horizontal distance between any two points on the line.
"In mathematical language, the slope m of the line is

  
    
      
        m
        =

        ."
{\displaystyle m={\frac {y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}}.}
The concept of slope applies directly to grades or gradients in geography and civil engineering.
"Through trigonometry, the slope m of a line is related to its angle of incline θ by the tangent function

  
    
      
        m
        =
        tan
        ⁡
        (
        θ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle m=\tan(\theta )}
  Thus, a 45° rising line has a slope of +1 and a 45° falling line has a slope of −1."
"As a generalization of this practical description, the mathematics of differential calculus defines the slope of a curve at a point as the slope of the tangent line at that point."
"When the curve is given by a series of points in a diagram or in a list of the coordinates of points, the slope may be calculated not at a point but between any two given points."
"When the curve is given as a continuous function, perhaps as an algebraic formula, then the differential calculus provides rules giving a formula for the slope of the curve at any point in the middle of the curve."
"This generalization of the concept of slope allows very complex constructions to be planned and built that go well beyond static structures that are either horizontals or verticals, but can change in time, move in curves, and change depending on the rate of change of other factors."
"Thereby, the simple idea of slope becomes one of the main basis of the modern world in terms of both technology and the built environment."
"Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)."
"It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients."
"Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure."
A number of natural states of water exist.
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog.
"Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state."
"When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow."
The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
"Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans."
"Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)."
"Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea."
Water plays an important role in the world economy.
Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.
Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.
"Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals."
"Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes."
"Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing."
"Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing."
A skull and crossbones is a symbol consisting of a human skull and two long bones crossed together under or behind the skull.
The design originated in the Late Middle Ages as a symbol of death and especially as a memento mori on tombstones.
"In modern contexts, it is generally used as a hazard symbol that warns of danger, usually in regard to poisonous substances,  such as deadly chemicals.It is also associated with piracy and software piracy, due to its historical use in some Jolly Roger flags."
"A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, and usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant."
"Gunpowder (""black powder"") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century."
"Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield."
A cannon is a type of heavy artillery weapon.
"The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed."
"In the modern era, the term cannon has fallen into decline, replaced by guns or artillery, if not a more specific term such as howitzer or mortar, except for high-caliber automatic weapons firing bigger rounds than machine guns, called autocannons."
"The earliest known depiction of cannons appeared in Song dynasty China as early as the 12th century; however, solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannons do not appear until the 13th century."
"In 1288 Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannon in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period."
"By the early 14th century, depictions of cannon had appeared in the Middle East and Europe, and recorded usage of cannon began appearing almost immediately after."
"By the end of the 14th century, cannons were widespread throughout Eurasia."
"Cannons were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374, when large cannons were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe."
"Cannons featured prominently as siege weapons, and ever larger pieces appeared."
"In 1464 a 16,000 kg (35,000 lbs) cannon known as the Great Turkish Bombard was created in the Ottoman Empire."
"Cannons as field artillery became more important after 1453, with the introduction of limber, which greatly improved cannon maneuverability and mobility."
"European cannons reached their longer, lighter, more accurate, and more efficient ""classic form"" around 1480."
This classic European cannon design stayed relatively consistent in form with minor changes until the 1750s.
The Three Stooges (promoted as The Three Stooges: The Movie) is a 2012 American slapstick comedy film based on the film shorts from 1934 to 1959 starring the comedy trio of the same name.
"The film was produced, written and directed by the Farrelly brothers and co-written by Mike Cerrone."
"It stars Chris Diamantopoulos, Sean Hayes, and Will Sasso, re-creating the eponymous characters played by Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard."
The film's story places the Stooges in a then-modern setting.
"After over a decade of casting problems, principal photography took place from May to July 2011."
"The film was released on April 13, 2012, by 20th Century Fox."
"A shape or figure is the form of an object or its external boundary, outline, or external surface, as opposed to other properties such as color, texture, or material type."
"A plane shape, two-dimensional shape, or 2D shape (plane figure, two-dimensional figure, or 2D figure) is constrained to lie on a plane, in contrast to solid figures."
"Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., Stools, Chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds, and hammocks)."
"Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers)."
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.
"In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose."
"It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood."
Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.
"People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites."
"Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones."
"Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne."
"The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone."
Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt.
"This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory."
"The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping."
"The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented."
Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century.
"The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs."
The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles.
The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism.
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.
"France (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ), officially the French Republic (French: République française), is a transcontinental country spanning Western Europe and overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans."
"Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and several islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean."
"Due to its several coastal territories, France has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world."
"France borders Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Monaco, Italy, Andorra and Spain in Europe, as well as the Netherlands, Suriname and Brazil in the Americas."
"Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and over 67 million people (as of May 2021)."
"France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Lyon, Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice."
"Inhabited since the Palaeolithic era, the territory of Metropolitan France was settled by Celtic tribes known as Gauls during the Iron Age."
"Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture that laid the foundation of the French language."
"The Germanic Franks  formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire."
"The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia becoming the Kingdom of France in 987."
"In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but highly decentralised feudal kingdom."
"Philip II successfully strengthened royal power and defeated his rivals to double the size of the crown lands; by the end of his reign, France had emerged as the most powerful state in Europe."
"From the mid-14th to the mid-15th century, France was plunged into a series of dynastic conflicts involving England, collectively known as the Hundred Years' War, and a distinct French identity emerged as a result."
"The French Renaissance saw art and culture flourish, conflict with the House of Habsburg, and the establishment of a global colonial empire, which by the 20th century would become the second-largest in the world."
The second half of the 16th century was dominated by religious civil wars between Catholics and Huguenots that severely weakened the country.
France again emerged as Europe's dominant power in the 17th century under Louis XIV following the Thirty Years' War.
"Inadequate economic policies, inequitable taxes and frequent wars (notably a defeat in the Seven Years' War and costly involvement in the American War of Independence), left the kingdom in a precarious economic situation by the end of the 18th century."
"This precipitated the French Revolution of 1789, which overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day."
"France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating much of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire."
The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars shaped the course of European and world history.
"The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870."
"Subsequent decades saw a period of optimism, cultural and scientific flourishing, as well as economic prosperity known as the Belle Époque."
"France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost."
"It was among the Allied powers of World War II, but was soon occupied by the Axis in 1940."
"Following liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the Algerian War."
The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle.
"Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France."
"France retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy."
"It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018."
"France is a developed country with the world's seventh-largest economy by nominal GDP and ninth-largest by PPP; in terms of aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world."
"France performs well in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy and human development."
"It remains a great power in global affairs, being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state."
"France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the Eurozone, as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and La Francophonie."

"A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed, and is called a normal deviate."
Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.
Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem.
"It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases."
"Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies."
"For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of normal deviates is a normal deviate."
"Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed."
A normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve.
"However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions)."
"A window is an opening in a wall, door, roof, or vehicle that allows the passage of light and may also allow the passage of sound and sometimes air."
"Modern windows are usually glazed or covered in some other transparent or translucent material, a sash set in a frame in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window."
"Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather."
Windows may have a latch or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.
"In addition to this, many modern day windows may have a window screen or mesh  (often made of aluminum or fibreglass) to keep bugs or insects out when the window is opened."
"Types include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, hexagonal windows, single-hung, and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding sash windows, casement windows, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt, and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or louvered windows, clerestory windows, lancet windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, Rose windows, emergency exit windows, stained glass windows, French windows, panel windows, double/triple-paned windows, and witch windows."
"The Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt, in Alexandria c. 100 AD."
"Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient China, Korea, and Japan."
"In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century."
"In the 19th century American west, greased paper windows came to be used by itinerant groups."
Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial plate glass making processes were fully perfected.
"In the field of international relations, a sphere of influence (SOI) is a spatial region or concept division over which a state or organization has a level of cultural, economic, military, or political exclusivity.While there may be a formal alliance or other treaty obligations between the influenced and influencer, such formal arrangements are not necessary and the influence can often be more of an example of soft power."
"Similarly, a formal alliance does not necessarily mean that one country lies within another's sphere of influence."
High levels of exclusivity have historically been associated with higher levels of conflict.
"In more extreme cases, a country within the ""sphere of influence"" of another may become a subsidiary of that state and serve in effect as a satellite state or de facto colony."
This was the case with the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc after World War II.
The system of spheres of influence by which powerful nations intervene in the affairs of others continues to the present.
"It is often analyzed in terms of superpowers, great powers, and/or middle powers."
Sometimes portions of a single country can fall into two distinct spheres of influence.
"In the colonial era the buffer states of Iran and Thailand, lying between the empires of Britain/Russia and Britain/France respectively, were divided between the spheres of influence of the imperial powers."
"Likewise, after World War II, Germany was divided into four occupation zones, three of which later consolidated into West Germany and the remaining one became East Germany, the former a member of NATO and the latter a member of the Warsaw Pact."
"The term is also used to describe non-political situations, e.g., a shopping mall is said to have a 'sphere of influence' that designates the geographical area where it dominates the retail trade."
A tire iron (also tire lever or tire spoon) is a specialized metal tool used in working with tires.
Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift to the use of tubeless tires in the late 1950s.
"Bicycle tire irons are still in use for those tires which have a separate inner tube, and can have a hooked C-shape cut into one end of the iron so that it may be hooked on a bicycle spoke to hold it in place."
"On the x86 architecture, a double fault exception occurs if the processor encounters a problem while trying to service a pending interrupt or exception."
An example situation when a double fault would occur is when an interrupt is triggered but the segment in which the interrupt handler resides is invalid.
"If the processor encounters a problem when calling the double fault handler, a triple fault is generated and the processor shuts down."
"As double faults can only happen due to kernel bugs, they are rarely caused by user space programs in a modern protected mode operating system, unless the program somehow gains kernel access (some viruses and also some low-level DOS programs)."
Other processors like PowerPC or SPARC generally save state to predefined and reserved machine registers.
A double fault will then be a situation where another exception happens while the processor is still using the contents of these registers to process the exception.
"SPARC processors have four levels of such registers, i.e."
they have a 4-window register system.
"Home of the Gentry (Russian: Дворянское гнездо Dvoryánskoye gnezdó pronounced [dvɐˈrʲanskʲɪɪ ɡnʲɪˈzdo]), also translated as A Nest of the Gentlefolk, A Nest of the Gentry and Liza , is a novel by Ivan Turgenev published in the January 1859 issue of Sovremennik."
It was enthusiastically received by the Russian society and remained his least controversial and most widely read novel until the end of the 19th century.
"Cabbage, comprising several cultivars of Brassica oleracea, is a leafy green, red (purple), or white (pale green) biennial plant grown as an annual vegetable crop for its dense-leaved heads."
It is descended from the wild cabbage (B. oleracea var.
"oleracea), and belongs to the ""cole crops"" or brassicas, meaning it is closely related to broccoli and cauliflower (var."
botrytis); Brussels sprouts (var.
gemmifera); and Savoy cabbage (var.
sabauda).
"A cabbage generally weighs between 500 to 1,000 grams (1 to 2 lb)."
"Smooth-leafed, firm-headed green cabbages are the most common, with smooth-leafed purple cabbages and crinkle-leafed savoy cabbages of both colours being rarer."
"Under conditions of long sunny days, such as those found at high northern latitudes in summer, cabbages can grow quite large."
"As of 2012, the heaviest cabbage was 62.71 kilograms (138 lb 4 oz)."
"Cabbage heads are generally picked during the first year of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed to grow a second year and must be kept separate from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination."
"Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases."
"Cabbage was most likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, although savoys were not developed until the 16th century AD."
"By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine."
"They can be prepared many different ways for eating; they can be pickled, fermented (for dishes such as sauerkraut), steamed, stewed, roasted, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw."
"Raw cabbage is a rich source of vitamin K, vitamin C, and dietary fiber."
"World production of cabbage and other brassicas in 2020 was 71 million tonnes, led by China with 48% of the total."
"In arithmetic and algebra, the fourth power of a number n is the result of multiplying four instances of n together."
"So:

n4 = n × n × n × nFourth powers are also formed by multiplying a number by its cube."
"Furthermore, they are squares of squares."
"The sequence of fourth powers of integers (also known as biquadrates or tesseractic numbers) is:

0, 1, 16, 81, 256, 625, 1296, 2401, 4096, 6561, 10000, 14641, 20736, 28561, 38416, 50625, 65536, 83521, 104976, 130321, 160000, 194481, 234256, 279841, 331776, 390625, 456976, 531441, 614656, 707281, 810000, ... (sequence A000583 in the OEIS)."
"A ship's company comprises all officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel aboard a naval vessel."
"The size of the ship's company (the complement) is the number of people on board, excluding civilians and guests."
"D-Link Corporation is a Taiwanese multinational networking equipment manufacturing corporation headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan."
It was founded in March 1986 in Taipei as Datex Systems Inc.
Self-denial (related but different from self-abnegation or self-sacrifice) is an act of letting go of the self as with altruistic abstinence – the willingness to forgo personal pleasures or undergo personal trials in the pursuit of the increased good of another.
"Various religions and cultures take differing views of self-denial, some considering it a positive trait and others considering it a negative one."
"According to some Protestants, self-denial is considered a superhuman virtue only obtainable through Jesus."
Some critics of self-denial suggest that self-denial can lead to self-hatred.
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"A coffee table is a low table designed to be placed in a sitting area for convenient support of beverages, remote controls, magazines, books (especially large, illustrated coffee table books), decorative objects, and other small items.Most coffee tables are made of wood (though faux wood tables are increasingly common) or glass and metal, typically, stainless steel or aluminum and may incorporate cabinets or drawers."
Coffee tables were thought to initially be constructed in Renaissance England.
"A cushion is a soft bag of some ornamental material, usually stuffed with wool, hair, feathers, polyester staple fiber, non-woven material, or even paper torn into fragments."
"It may be used for sitting or kneeling upon, or to soften the hardness or angularity of a chair or couch."
"Decorative cushions often have a patterned cover material, and are used as decoration for furniture."
"A cushion is also referred to as a bolster, hassock, headrest, a tush, and a sham.Cushions and rugs can be used temporarily outside to soften a hard ground."
They can be placed on sunloungers and used to prevent annoyances from moist grass and biting insects.
Some dialects of English use this word to refer to throw pillows as well.
The cushion is a very ancient article of furniture; the inventories of the contents of palaces and great houses in the early Middle Ages constantly made mention of them.
"Cushions were then often of great size, covered with leather, and firm enough to serve as a seat, but the steady tendency of all furniture has been to grow smaller with time."
"Today, the cushion is considered an upholstery item."
"In computing, file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved."
"Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stopped and the next began, or where any piece of data was located when it was time to retrieve it."
"By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified."
"Taking its name from the way a paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a ""file."""
"The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a ""file system."""
There are many different kinds of file systems.
"Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, size and more."
Some file systems have been designed to be used for specific applications.
"For example, the ISO 9660 file system is designed specifically for optical discs."
File systems can be used on numerous different types of storage devices that use different kinds of media.
"As of 2019, hard disk drives have been key storage devices and are projected to remain so for the foreseeable future."
"Other kinds of media that are used include SSDs, magnetic tapes, and optical discs."
"In some cases, such as with tmpfs, the computer's main memory (random-access memory, RAM) is used to create a temporary file system for short-term use."
"Some file systems are used on local data storage devices; others provide file access via a network protocol (for example, NFS, SMB, or 9P clients)."
"Some file systems are ""virtual"", meaning that the supplied ""files"" (called virtual files) are computed on request (such as procfs and sysfs) or are merely a mapping into a different file system used as a backing store."
The file system manages access to both the content of files and the metadata about those files.
"It is responsible for arranging storage space; reliability, efficiency, and tuning with regard to the physical storage medium are important design considerations."
Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper or other two-dimensional surface.
"Drawing instruments include graphite pencils, pen and ink, various kinds of paints, inked brushes, colored pencils, crayons, charcoal, chalk, pastels, erasers, markers, styluses, and metals (such as silverpoint)."
Digital drawing is the act of drawing on graphics software in a computer.
"Common methods of digital drawing include a stylus or finger on a touchscreen device, stylus- or finger-to-touchpad, or in some cases, a mouse."
There are many digital art programs and devices.
"A drawing instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a visible mark."
"The most common support for drawing is paper, although other materials, such as cardboard, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and board, have been used."
Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or whiteboard.
Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public expression throughout human history.
It is one of the simplest and most efficient means of communicating ideas.
The wide availability of drawing instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities.
"In addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and technical drawing."
"A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a finished work, is sometimes called a sketch."
"An artist who practices or works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or draughtsman."
"In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography)."
"Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law."
"Apart from the global continental regions, there are also hydrospheric and atmospheric regions that cover the oceans, and discrete climates above the land and water masses of the planet."
"The land and water global regions are divided into subregions geographically bounded by large geological features that influence large-scale ecologies, such as plains and features."
"As a way of describing spatial areas, the concept of regions is important and widely used among the many branches of geography, each of which can describe areas in regional terms."
"For example, ecoregion is a term used in environmental geography, cultural region in cultural geography, bioregion in biogeography, and so on."
The field of geography that studies regions themselves is called regional geography.
"In the fields of physical geography, ecology, biogeography, zoogeography, and environmental geography, regions tend to be based on natural features such as ecosystems or biotopes, biomes, drainage basins, natural regions, mountain ranges, soil types."
"Where human geography is concerned, the regions and subregions are described by the discipline of ethnography."
A region has its own nature that could not be moved.
"The first nature is its natural environment (landform, climate, etc.)."
The second nature is its physical elements complex that was built by people in the past.
The third nature is its socio-cultural context that could not be replaced by new immigrants.
A utility knife is any type of knife used for general manual work purposes.
"Such knives were originally fixed-blade knives with durable cutting edges suitable for rough work such as cutting cordage, cutting/scraping hides, butchering animals, cleaning fish scales, reshaping timber, and other tasks."
"Craft knives are small utility knives used as precision-oriented tools for finer, more delicate tasks such as carving and papercutting."
"Today, the term ""utility knife"" also includes small folding-, retractable- and/or replaceable-razor blade knives suited for use in the general workplace or in the construction industry."
"The latter type is sometimes generically called a Stanley knife, after a prominent brand."
"There is also a utility knife for kitchen use, which is sized between a chef's knife and paring knife."
"In vertebrate anatomy, hip (or ""coxa"" in medical terminology) refers to either an anatomical region or a joint."
"The hip region is located lateral and anterior to the gluteal region, inferior to the iliac crest, and overlying the greater trochanter of the femur, or ""thigh bone""."
"In adults, three of the bones of the pelvis have fused into the hip bone or acetabulum which forms part of the hip region."
"The hip joint, scientifically referred to as the acetabulofemoral joint (art."
"coxae), is the joint between the head of the femur and acetabulum of the pelvis and its primary function is to support the weight of the body in both static (e.g., standing) and dynamic (e.g., walking or running) postures."
"The hip joints have very important roles in retaining balance, and for maintaining the pelvic inclination angle."
"Pain of the hip may be the result of numerous causes, including nervous, osteoarthritic, infectious, traumatic, and genetic."
An icicle is a spike of ice formed when water falling from an object freezes.
"A coffeemaker, coffee maker or coffee machine is a cooking appliance used to brew coffee."
"While there are many different types of coffeemakers using several different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed into a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic coffee pot, a cooking pot in the kettle family."
"Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then boiled and directed into the funnel."
This is also called automatic drip-brew.
"Property is a system of rights that gives people legal control of valuable things, and also refers to the valuable things themselves."
"Depending on the nature of the property, an owner of property may have the right to consume, alter, share, redefine, rent, mortgage, pawn, sell, exchange, transfer, give away or destroy it, or to exclude others from doing these things, as well as to perhaps abandon it; whereas regardless of the nature of the property, the owner thereof has the right to properly use it (as a durable, mean or factor, or whatever), or at the very least exclusively keep it."
"In economics and political economy, there are three broad forms of property: private property, public property, and collective property (also called cooperative property)."
"Property that jointly belongs to more than one party may be possessed or controlled thereby in very similar or very distinct ways, whether simply or complexly, whether equally or unequally."
"However, there is an expectation that each party's will (rather discretion) with regard to the property be clearly defined and unconditional, so as to distinguish ownership and easement from rent."
"The parties might expect their wills to be unanimous, or alternately every given one of them, when no opportunity for or possibility of dispute with any other of them exists, may expect his, her, its or their own will to be sufficient and absolute."
"The Restatement (First) of Property defines property as anything, tangible or intangible whereby a legal relationship between persons and the state enforces a possessory interest or legal title in that thing."
"This mediating relationship between individual, property and state is called a property regime.In sociology and anthropology, property is often defined as a relationship between two or more individuals and an object, in which at least one of these individuals holds a bundle of rights over the object."
"The distinction between ""collective property"" and ""private property"" is regarded as a confusion since different individuals often hold differing rights over a single object.Types of property include real property (the combination of land and any improvements to or on the land), personal property (physical possessions belonging to a person), private property (property owned by legal persons, business entities or individual natural persons), public property (state owned or publicly owned and available possessions) and intellectual property (exclusive rights over artistic creations, inventions, etc."
"), although the last is not always as widely recognized or enforced."
An article of property may have physical and incorporeal parts.
"A title, or a right of ownership, establishes the relation between the property and other persons, assuring the owner the right to dispose of the property as the owner sees fit."
"The unqualified term ""property"" is often used to refer specifically to real property."
"A role (also rôle or social role) is a set of connected behaviors, rights, obligations, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation."
It is an expected or free or continuously changing behavior and may have a given individual social status or social position.
It is vital to both functionalist and interactionist understandings of society.
"Social role theory posits the following about social behavior:

The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialized positions, we call roles."
"Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behavior and actions that recur in a group, guided by social norms, which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behavior in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society."
"Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called actors."
"When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role legitimate and constructive), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to punish those who violate role norms."
"Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change."
"The anticipation of rewards and punishments, as well as the satisfaction of behaving pro-socially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.The notion of the role can be and is examined in the social sciences, specifically economics, sociology and organizational theory."
Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
"It typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing, ""non-linear"" manner, such that many ideas are generated in an emergent cognitive fashion."
"Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn."
"Following divergent thinking, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ""correct"" solution."
The psychologist J.P. Guilford first coined the terms convergent thinking and divergent thinking in 1956.
West or Occident is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass.
It is the opposite direction from East and is the direction in which the sun sets.
An alligator is a crocodilian in the genus Alligator of the family Alligatoridae.
The two extant species are the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis).
"Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains."
"Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago.The name ""alligator"" is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto, the Spanish term for ""the lizard"", which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator."
Later English spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto.
"A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process."
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
"In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity."
"The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment."
"Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and sewing patterns.The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a fashion designer, product designer, web designer or interior designer), but also others such as architects and engineers."
"A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods."
"The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design."
"A branch, sometimes called a ramus in botany, is a woody structural member connected to but not part of the central trunk of a tree (or sometimes a shrub)."
Large branches are known as boughs and small branches are known as twigs.
"The term twig often refers to a terminus, while bough refers only to branches coming directly from the trunk."
"Due to a broad range of species of trees, branches and twigs can be found in many different shapes and sizes."
"While branches can be nearly horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, the majority of trees have upwardly diagonal branches."
"A number of mathematical properties are associated with tree branchings; they are natural examples of fractal patterns in nature, and, as observed by Leonardo da Vinci, their cross-sectional areas closely follow the da Vinci branching rule."
"China (Chinese: 中国; pinyin: Zhōngguó), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: 中华人民共和国; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó), is a country in East Asia."
"It is the world's most populous country, with a population of more than 1.4 billion."
"China spans five geographical time zones and borders 14 different countries, the second most of any country in the world after Russia."
"Covering an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the world's third or fourth largest country."
"The country consists of 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two Special Administrative Regions (Hong Kong and Macau)."
The national capital is Beijing.
China emerged as one of the world's first civilizations in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain.
China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century.
"For millennia, China's political system was based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-legendary Xia dynasty in the 21st century BCE."
"Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times."
"In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire."
"The succeeding Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements."
The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions.
"Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Road brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa."
"The Qing dynasty, China's last dynasty, which formed the territorial basis for modern China, suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism in the 19th century."
"The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty."
China was invaded by the Empire of Japan during World War II.
The Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan.
"Both claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, although the United Nations has recognized the PRC as the sole representation since 1971."
"China conducted a series of economic reforms since 1978, and entered into the World Trade Organization in 2001."
China is currently governed as a unitary one-party socialist republic by the CCP.
"China is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the RCEP, and is a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit."
"It ranks among the lowest in international measurements of civil liberties, government transparency, freedom of the press, freedom of religion and ethnic minorities."
"Chinese authorities have been criticized by political dissidents and human rights activists for widespread human rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass surveillance of their citizens and violent suppression of protests."
"China is the world's largest economy by GDP at purchasing power parity, second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the world's second wealthiest country by total wealth."
The country has a fast growing major economy and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter.
China is a recognized nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and second-largest defense budget.
A roadblock is a temporary installation set up to control or block traffic along a road.
"The reasons for one could be:

Roadworks
Temporary road closure during special events
Police chase
Robbery
Sobriety checkpointIn peaceful circumstances, they are usually installed by the police or road transport authorities; they are also commonly employed during wars and are usually staffed by heavily armed soldiers in that case."
"During protests and riots, both police and demonstrators sometimes use roadblocks."
"A suckling pig is a piglet fed on its mother's milk (i.e., a piglet which is still a ""suckling"")."
"In culinary contexts, a suckling pig is slaughtered between the ages of two and six weeks."
"It is traditionally cooked whole, often roasted, in various cuisines."
It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.
The meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for pork rinds.
The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of collagen in a young pig.
"Cornish game hen (also Rock Cornish game hen) is the USDA-approved name for a particular variety of broiler chicken, produced from a cross between the Cornish and White Plymouth Rock chicken breeds, that is served young and immature, weighing no more than two pounds (900 g) ready to cook.Despite the name, the Cornish game hen is not a game bird."
"The name is also a misnomer because both males and females are served as Cornish game hens, meaning that many are not actually hens."
"Bred to develop a large breast over a short period of time, the fowl weighs roughly 2.5 pounds (1.1 kilograms) when slaughtered at four to six weeks of age and typically commands a higher price per pound than mature chicken."
Adult Cornish game hens are not smaller than standard broiler chickens; the size of cooked Cornish game hens is due solely to the very young age at which they are slaughtered.
A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor.
"A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale."
"Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol."
The vestibulospinal tract is a neural tract in the central nervous system.
"Specifically, it is a component of the extrapyramidal system and is classified as a component of the medial pathway."
"Like other descending motor pathways, the vestibulospinal fibers of the tract relay information from nuclei to motor neurons."
The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head.
The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract.
"The function of these motor commands is to alter muscle tone, extend, and change the position of the limbs and head with the goal of supporting posture and maintaining balance of the body and head."
"A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an open wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a closed wound)."
"In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the epidermis of the skin."
The Atlantic sailfish (Istiophorus albicans) is a species of marine fish in the family Istiophoridae of the order Perciformes.
"It is found in the Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, except for large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic, from the surface to depths of 200 m (656 ft)."
The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.
"Tests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to 111 kilometres per hour; however, more conservative estimates of 37 to 55 kilometres per hour are more widely accepted."
"More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of 36 km/h (22 mph).Atlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods."
"A space suit or spacesuit is a garment worn to keep a human alive in the harsh environment of outer space, vacuum and temperature extremes."
"Space suits are often worn inside spacecraft as a safety precaution in case of loss of cabin pressure, and are necessary for extravehicular activity (EVA), work done outside spacecraft."
"Space suits have been worn for such work in Earth orbit, on the surface of the Moon, and en route back to Earth from the Moon."
"Modern space suits augment the basic pressure garment with a complex system of equipment and environmental systems designed to keep the wearer comfortable, and to minimize the effort required to bend the limbs, resisting a soft pressure garment's natural tendency to stiffen against the vacuum."
"A self-contained oxygen supply and environmental control system is frequently employed to allow complete freedom of movement, independent of the spacecraft."
"Three types of space suits exist for different purposes: IVA (intravehicular activity), EVA (extravehicular activity), and IEVA (intra/extravehicular activity)."
"IVA suits are meant to be worn inside a pressurized spacecraft, and are therefore lighter and more comfortable."
"IEVA suits are meant for use inside and outside the spacecraft, such as the Gemini G4C suit."
"They include more protection from the harsh conditions of space, such as protection from micrometeoroids and extreme temperature change."
"EVA suits, such as the EMU, are used outside spacecraft, for either planetary exploration or spacewalks."
"They must protect the wearer against all conditions of space, as well as provide mobility and functionality.Some of these requirements also apply to pressure suits worn for other specialized tasks, such as high-altitude reconnaissance flight."
"At altitudes above the Armstrong limit, around 19,000 m (62,000 ft), water boils at body temperature and pressurized suits are needed."
The first full-pressure suits for use at extreme altitudes were designed by individual inventors as early as the 1930s.
The first space suit worn by a human in space was the Soviet SK-1 suit worn by Yuri Gagarin in 1961.
"A refrigerator (colloquially fridge) is a commercial and home appliance consisting of a thermally insulated compartment and a heat pump (mechanical, electronic or chemical) that transfers heat from its inside to its external environment so that its inside is cooled to a temperature below the room temperature."
The refrigerator should be kept at or below 4 °C (40 °F) and the freezer should be regulated at −18 °C (0 °F).
Refrigeration is an essential food storage technique around the world.
"The lower temperature lowers the reproduction rate of bacteria, so the refrigerator reduces the rate of spoilage."
A refrigerator maintains a temperature a few degrees above the freezing point of water.
The optimal temperature range for perishable food storage is 3 to 5 °C (37 to 41 °F).
A similar device that maintains a temperature below the freezing point of water is called a freezer.
"The refrigerator replaced the icebox, which had been a common household appliance for almost a century and a half."
The first cooling systems for food involved ice.
"Artificial refrigeration began in the mid-1750s, and developed in the early 1800s."
"In 1834, the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system was built."
The first commercial ice-making machine was invented in 1854.
"In 1913, refrigerators for home use were invented."
In 1923 Frigidaire introduced the first self-contained unit.
The introduction of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s.
Home freezers as separate compartments (larger than necessary just for ice cubes) were introduced in 1940.
"Frozen foods, previously a luxury item, became commonplace."
Freezer units are used in households as well as in industry and commerce.
Commercial refrigerator and freezer units were in use for almost 40 years prior to the common home models.
"The freezer-over-refrigerator style had been the basic style since the 1940s, until modern, side-by-side refrigerators broke the trend."
"A vapor compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators, refrigerator–freezers and freezers."
"Newer refrigerators may include automatic defrosting, chilled water, and ice from a dispenser in the door."
Domestic refrigerators and freezers for food storage are made in a range of sizes.
Among the smallest are Peltier-type refrigerators designed to chill beverages.
A large domestic refrigerator stands as tall as a person and may be about one metre (3 ft 3 in) wide with a capacity of 0.6 m3 (21 cu ft).
"Refrigerators and freezers may be free-standing, or built into a kitchen."
The refrigerator allows the modern household to keep food fresh for longer than before.
"Freezers allow people to buy perishable food in bulk and eat it at leisure, and have bulk purchases."
"Yarn is a long continuous length of interlocked fibres, suitable for use in the production of textiles, sewing, crocheting, knitting, weaving, embroidery, or ropemaking."
Thread is a type of yarn intended for sewing by hand or machine.
Modern manufactured sewing threads may be finished with wax or other lubricants to withstand the stresses involved in sewing.
Embroidery threads are yarns specifically designed for needlework.
"A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process."
The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design.
"In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity."
"The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment."

"A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods."
"The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design."
American Idiot is a sung-through rock musical based on the concept album of the same name by punk rock band Green Day.
"After a run at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in 2009, the show moved to the St. James Theatre on Broadway."
"Previews began on March 24, 2010, and the musical officially opened on April 20, 2010."
"The show closed on April 24, 2011, after 422 performances."
"While Green Day did not appear in the production, vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong performed the role of ""St. Jimmy"" occasionally throughout the run."
"The story, expanded from that of the album, centres on three disaffected young men, Johnny, Will and Tunny."
"Johnny and Tunny flee a stifling suburban lifestyle and parental restrictions, while Will stays at home to work out his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend, Heather."
The former pair look for meaning in life and try out the freedom and excitement of the city.
"Tunny quickly gives up on life in the city, joins the military and is shipped off to war."
"Johnny turns to drugs and finds a part of himself that he grows to dislike, has a relationship and experiences lost love."
The book was written by Armstrong and director Michael Mayer.
The music was composed by Green Day and the lyrics were by Armstrong.
"The score included all the songs from the band's original American Idiot album, as well as additional Green Day songs from the 2009 concept album 21st Century Breakdown, and ""When It's Time"", a song originally only released as a single in Britain."
The musical won two Tony Awards: Best Scenic Design of a Musical for Christine Jones and Best Lighting Design of a Musical for Kevin Adams.
It also received a nomination for Best Musical.
"In 2011, its Broadway cast recording won a Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album."
"A doll is a model typically of a human or humanoid character, often used as a toy for children, especially little girls."
Dolls have also been used in traditional religious rituals throughout the world.
"Traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe."
"The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome."
"They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art."
"Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, from the 15th century."
"With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced."
"During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles."
"In its most general sense, the term ""world"" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is."
The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
"Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a ""plurality of worlds""."
Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts.
"In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as ""[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be""."
"Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been."
"Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the ""horizon of all horizons""."
"In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind."
"Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent."
"In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice."
"A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview."
Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.
"In various contexts, the term ""world"" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope."
"In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents."
"Other examples include terms such as ""world religion"", ""world language"", ""world government"", ""world war"", ""world population"", ""world economy"" or ""world championship""."
"In meteorology, a cloud is an aerosol consisting of a visible mass of minute liquid droplets, frozen crystals, or other particles suspended in the atmosphere of a planetary body or similar space."
Water or various other chemicals may compose the droplets and crystals.
"On Earth, clouds are formed as a result of saturation of the air when it is cooled to its dew point, or when it gains sufficient moisture (usually in the form of water vapor) from an adjacent source to raise the dew point to the ambient temperature."
"They are seen in the Earth's homosphere, which includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere."
"Nephology is the science of clouds, which is undertaken in the cloud physics branch of meteorology."
"There are two methods of naming clouds in their respective layers of the homosphere, Latin and common."
"Genus types in the troposphere, the atmospheric layer closest to Earth's surface, have Latin names because of the universal adoption of Luke Howard's nomenclature that was formally proposed in 1802."
It became the basis of a modern international system that divides clouds into five physical forms which can be further divided or classified into altitude levels to derive ten basic genera.
"The main representative cloud types for each of these forms are stratus, cirrus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus."
Low-level  clouds do not have any altitude-related prefixes.
However mid-level stratiform and stratocumuliform types are given the prefix alto- while high-level variants of these same two forms carry the prefix cirro-.
"In both cases, strato- is dropped from the latter form to avoid double-prefixing."
Genus types with sufficient vertical extent to occupy more than one level do not carry any altitude related prefixes.
"They are classified formally as low- or mid-level depending on the altitude at which each initially forms, and are also more informally characterized as multi-level or vertical."
Most of the ten genera derived by this method of classification can be subdivided into species and further subdivided into varieties.
"Very low stratiform clouds that extend down to the Earth's surface are given the common names fog and mist, but have no Latin names."
"In the stratosphere and mesosphere, clouds have common names for their main types."
"They may have the appearance of  stratiform veils or sheets, cirriform wisps, or stratocumuliform bands or ripples."
"They are seen infrequently, mostly in the polar regions of Earth."
Clouds have been observed in the atmospheres of other planets and moons in the Solar System and beyond.
"However, due to their different temperature characteristics, they are often composed of other substances such as methane, ammonia, and sulfuric acid, as well as water."
Tropospheric clouds can have a direct effect on climate change on Earth.
"They may reflect incoming rays from the sun which can contribute to a cooling effect where and when these clouds occur, or trap longer wave radiation that reflects back up from the Earth's surface which can cause a warming effect."
"The altitude, form, and thickness of the clouds are the main factors that affect the local heating or cooling of Earth and the atmosphere."
Clouds that form above the troposphere are too scarce and too thin to have any influence on climate change.
Clouds are the main uncertainty in climate sensitivity.
"A pancake (or hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack) is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk and butter and cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often frying with oil or butter."
It is a type of batter bread.
Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably the earliest and most widespread cereal food eaten in prehistoric societies.The pancake's shape and structure varies worldwide.
"In the United Kingdom, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe."
"In North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake."
A crêpe is a thin Breton pancake of French origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles.
"A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is a palačinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used."
"When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake."
Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries.
"Like waffles, commercially prepared frozen pancakes are available from companies like Eggo."
"When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland and the US."
"Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes Blini, Kaletez, Ploye, and Memil-buchimgae."
"Pancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions."
"In North America, they are typically considered a breakfast food and serve a similar function to waffles."
"In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as ""Pancake Day"", when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent."
Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
"It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches."
It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
"Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers."
The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and  stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming.
"The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F)."
It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.
"The meaning of the name ""ice cream"" varies from one country to another."
"Ice cream and gelato, based on cream and milk."
"Frozen yogurt, based on yogurt or kefir."
"Frozen custard, with eggs added to cream and sugar."
Ice milk.
"Sorbet/slushy, ice pop/popsicle/icicle: Water base."
"Examples: frozen cola, frozen lemonade, frozen tea."
"Sherbet, like sorbet but with some milk added.In some countries, such as the United States, ""ice cream"" applies only to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main ingredients, notably the amount of cream."
"Products that do not meet the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled ""frozen dairy dessert"" instead."
"In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina, one word is used for all variants."
"Analogues made from dairy alternatives, such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,  almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy protein, or vegan."
"Ice cream may be served in dishes, for eating with a spoon, or licked from edible wafer cones."
"Ice cream may be served with other desserts, such as apple pie, or as an ingredient in ice cream floats, sundaes, milkshakes, ice cream cakes and even baked items, such as Baked Alaska."
"A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light appearing in the sky."
It takes the form of a multicoloured circular arc.
Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun.
Rainbows can be full circles.
"However, the observer normally sees only an arc formed by illuminated droplets above the ground, and centered on a line from the Sun to the observer's eye."
"In a primary rainbow, the arc shows red on the outer part and violet on the inner side."
"This rainbow is caused by light being refracted when entering a droplet of water, then reflected inside on the back of the droplet and refracted again when leaving it."
"In a double rainbow, a second arc is seen outside the primary arc, and has the order of its colours reversed, with red on the inner side of the arc."
This is caused by the light being reflected twice on the inside of the droplet before leaving it.
"An infidel (literally ""unfaithful"") is a person accused of disbelief in the central tenets of one's own religion, such as members of another religion, or the irreligious.Infidel is an ecclesiastical term in Christianity around which the Church developed a body of theology that deals with the concept of infidelity, which makes a clear differentiation between those who were baptized and followed the teachings of the Church versus those who are outside the faith."
The term infidel was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity.
"After the ancient world, the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (cf."
"pagan).In modern literature, the term infidel includes in its scope atheists, polytheists, animists, heathens and pagans.A willingness to identify other religious people as infidels corresponds to preference for orthodoxy over pluralism."
"Dexter: New Blood is an American crime drama mystery miniseries developed for Showtime as a continuation of the series Dexter, developed by original series showrunner Clyde Phillips and directed by Marcos Siega."
"The show features Michael C. Hall and Jennifer Carpenter reprising their roles as Dexter and Debra Morgan, respectively, alongside new cast members Jack Alcott, Julia Jones, Johnny Sequoyah, Alano Miller and Clancy Brown."
"The story is set 10 years after the events of the original series finale ""Remember the Monsters?"
""", which was broadcast in 2013."
"It premiered on Showtime on November 7, 2021."
Character evidence is a term used in the law of evidence to describe any testimony or document submitted for the purpose of proving that a person acted in a particular way on a particular occasion based on the character or disposition of that person.
"In the United States, Federal Rule of Evidence 404 maps out its permissible and prohibited uses in trials."
"Three factors typically determine the admissibility of character evidence: 

the purpose the character evidence is being used for
the form in which the character evidence is offered
the type of proceeding (civil or criminal) in which the character evidence is offered"
"Calochortus elegans is a species of flowering plant in the lily family known by the common name elegant Mariposa lily, cat's ear, elegant cat's ears or star tulip."
"It is native to the western United States from northern California to Montana.It is a perennial herb producing a slender, generally unbranched stem up to 15 centimeters in height."
The basal leaf is 10 to 20 centimeters long and does not wither at flowering.
The inflorescence bears 1 to 7 erect bell-shaped flowers.
Each flower has three sepals and three petals with very hairy inner surfaces and edges.
Each petal is greenish white in color with a purple crescent above a hairless patch at the base.
"The fruit is a winged capsule about 2 centimeters long.The bulb is a choice wild root vegetable when eaten cooked, and can be eaten raw to avoid starvation."

"In Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral, which means that it has four equal sides and four equal angles (90-degree angles, π/2 radian angles, or right angles)."
It can also be defined as a rectangle in which two adjacent sides have equal length.
"A square with vertices ABCD would be denoted 
  
    
      
        ◻
      
    
    {\displaystyle \square }
   ABCD."
"Time is the continued sequence of existence and events that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future."
"It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience."
"Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions.Time has long been an important subject of study in religion, philosophy, and science, but defining it in a manner applicable to all fields without circularity has consistently eluded scholars."
"Nevertheless, diverse fields such as business, industry, sports, the sciences, and the performing arts all incorporate some notion of time into their respective measuring systems.Time in physics is operationally defined as ""what a clock reads"".The physical nature of time is addressed by general relativity with respect to events in spacetime."
"Examples of events are the collision of two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship."
Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates).
"However, the numerical values are different for different observers."
"In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer."
"Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley."
General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds.
"At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity.Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities."
The SI base unit of time is the second.
Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.
"An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life."
"To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted."
The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is.
"It does not address why events can happen forward and backward in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time."
Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum.
General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works.
"Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of spacetime, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes."
"Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy."
Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time.
"Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart."
"Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below)."
"Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (""time is money"") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans."
"There are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time."
"In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another."
"A private protected area, also known as a private reserve, is not an official category within IUCN's Protected Area guidelines, but includes those protected areas that fall under geographical space that is privately owned, 'kept aside' for public benefit, and will be likely to fall into any one of the IUCN Protected Area Management Categories.The IUCN defines a private protected area as “a land parcel of any size that is..."": 

""Predominantly managed for biodiversity conservation;
""Protected with or without formal government recognition; and
""Is owned or otherwise secured by individuals, communities, corporations, or non-governmental organisations.”A Private Protected Area represents a private initiative towards preserving biodiversity, which indicates the importance of the involvement of individuals, corporations, and other private bodies in the understanding and maintenance of protected areas."
"In Eastern and Southern Africa, privately owned lands play an important role in conserving critical biodiversity."
"Private protected areas in Southern Africa alone protect millions of ecologically important areas, especially in critical buffer zones and corridor areas."
"""The Brown Paper Bag Test"" is a term in African-American oral history to describe a colorist discriminatory practice within the African-American community in the 20th century, in which an individual's skin tone is compared to the color of a brown paper bag."
This test can be traced back to the time of slavery where slave masters kept the lighter-skinned slaves inside.
The test was allegedly used to determine what privileges an individual could have; only those with a skin color that matched or was lighter than a brown paper bag were allowed admission or membership privileges.
"The test was believed by many to be used in the 20th century by many African-American social institutions such as sororities, fraternities, and churches."
The term is also used in reference to larger issues of class and social stratification and colorism within the African-American population.
People were barred from having access to several public spaces and resources because of their darker complexion.
The test was used at the entrance to social functions wherein a brown paper bag was stuck at the door and anyone who was darker than the bag was denied entry.
Volume is a scalar quantity expressing the amount of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface.
"For example, the space that a substance (solid, liquid, gas, or plasma) or 3D shape occupies or contains."
"Volume is often quantified numerically using the SI derived unit, the cubic metre."
"The volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container; i.e., the amount of fluid (gas or liquid) that the container could hold, rather than the amount of space the container itself displaces."
Three dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes.
"Volumes of some simple shapes, such as regular, straight-edged, and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas."
Volumes of complicated shapes can be calculated with integral calculus if a formula exists for the shape's boundary.
One-dimensional figures (such as lines) and two-dimensional shapes (such as squares) are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional space.
The volume of a solid (whether regularly or irregularly shaped) can be determined by fluid displacement.
Displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas.
The combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of just one of the substances.
"However, sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and in such cases the combined volume is not additive.In differential geometry, volume is expressed by means of the volume form, and is an important global Riemannian invariant."
"In thermodynamics, volume is a fundamental parameter, and is a conjugate variable to pressure."
"A solar furnace is a structure that uses concentrated solar power to produce high temperatures, usually for industry."
Parabolic mirrors or heliostats concentrate light (Insolation) onto a focal point.
"The temperature at the focal point may reach 3,500 °C (6,330 °F), and this heat can be used to generate electricity, melt steel, make hydrogen fuel or nanomaterials."
"The largest solar furnace is at Odeillo in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France, opened in 1970."
"It employs an array of plane mirrors to gather sunlight, reflecting it onto a larger curved mirror."
A people is any plurality of persons considered as a whole.
"Used in politics and law it is a term to refer to the collective or community of an ethnic group, a nation, to the public or common mass of people of a polity."
"As such it is a concept of human rights law, international law as well as constitutional law, particularly used for claims of popular sovereignty."
"A powder is a dry, bulk solid composed of many very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted."
"Powders are a special sub-class of granular materials, although the terms powder and granular are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material."
"In particular, powders refer to those granular materials that have the finer grain sizes, and that therefore have a greater tendency to form clumps when flowing."
Granulars refers to the coarser granular materials that do not tend to form clumps except when wet.
A clerk is a senior official of many municipal governments in the English-speaking world.
"In some communities, including most in the United States, the position is elected, but in many others, the clerk is appointed to their post."
"In the UK, a Town or Parish clerk is appointed by the Town or Parish Council Members."
"In almost all cases, the actual title of the clerk reflects the type of municipality they work for, thus, instead of simply being known as the clerk, the position is generally referred to as the town clerk, township clerk, city clerk, village clerk, borough clerk, board secretary, or county clerk."
"Other titles also exist, such as recorder."
"The office has existed for centuries, though in some places it is now being merged with other positions."
The duties of a municipal clerk vary even more than their titles.
"In the United Kingdom, a clerk is generally responsible for a Local Council (Town or Parish)."
"Particularly in the United States, it is difficult to fully describe a clerk's duties, because there are hundreds of different jobs a clerk may fulfill."
"In some U.S. states, there are provisions in the state constitutions delineating the clerk's duties, but in other states, each municipality decides for itself what role the clerk plays."
"Apple cider (also called sweet cider, soft cider, or simply cider) is the name used in the United States and Canada for an unfiltered, unsweetened, non-alcoholic beverage made from apples."
"Though typically referred to simply as ""cider"" in the United States, it is not to be confused with the alcoholic beverage known as cider in other places, which is called ""hard cider"" in the US."
"Outside of the United States and Canada, it is commonly referred to as cloudy apple juice to distinguish it from clearer, filtered apple juice and hard cider."
"Fresh liquid cider is extracted from the whole apple itself, including the apple core, trimmings from apples, and oddly sized or shaped “imperfect” apples, aka apple culls."
"Fresh cider is opaque due to fine apple particles in suspension and generally tangier than commercially cooked and filtered apple juice, but this depends somewhat on the variety of apples used."
"Cider is sometimes pasteurized or exposed to UV light to kill bacteria and extend its shelf life, but traditional raw untreated cider is still common."
"Some companies have begun adding preservatives and boiling cider, so that it can be shelf stable and stored without refrigeration."
"In either form, apple cider is seasonally produced in autumn."
"It is traditionally served throughout autumn on the Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and various New Year's Eve holidays, sometimes heated and mulled."
A goose (PL: geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.
This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese and white geese) and Branta (the black geese).
"Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have ""goose"" as part of their names."
"More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller."
"The term ""goose"" may refer to either a male or female bird, but when paired with ""gander"",  refers specifically to a female one (the latter referring to a male)."
Young birds before fledging are called goslings.
"The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge; when flying close together, they are called a plump."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"Hitman is a stealth video game franchise developed by the Danish developer IO Interactive, and previously published by Eidos Interactive and Square Enix."
"IO Interactive remained a subsidiary of Square Enix until 2017, when Square Enix started seeking buyers for the studio."
"IO Interactive completed a management buyout, regaining their independent status and retaining the rights for Hitman, in June 2017."
"The games are available for macOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows and multiple consoles, including the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and Stadia (under the title Hitman: World of Assassination)."
"The series started with 2000's Hitman: Codename 47, and has featured eight main games in total, the most recent being Hitman 3, released January 2021."
"Main games in the Hitman series are set in semi-open world environments and presented from the third-person perspective, and have players eliminate specific targets assigned to them while trying to remain as stealthy as possible by various means; these include taking disguises, hiding from suspicious enemies, and using suppressed weaponry."
"The series' main protagonist and playable character is Agent 47, the eponymous hitman, who works for the fictional International Contract Agency (ICA)."
"Originating as a clone who was genetically-engineered to maintain peak human physicality and intelligence, be easy to control, and display a cold and monotone personality, 47 is regarded as the best assassin in the world."
"Although most of the Hitman games tend to tell their own independent narrative, there are several story arcs that span multiple games in the series, and each entry so far has been connected, even if loosely, to previous ones, creating a sense of continuity."
"Most of the storylines in the series revolve around 47 gradually unravelling and subsequently stopping a major conspiracy, while also developing his mysterious background, humane side, and relationships with various recurring characters."
The main games in the Hitman series have received generally positive reviews for their unique approach to stealth gameplay and highly competent artificial intelligence.
The franchise has shipped over 15 million copies worldwide as of 2015.
"Outside of the eight mainline games, the Hitman franchise also includes two spin-offs for mobile devices, Hitman Go (2014) and Hitman Sniper (2015); two novels, Hitman: Enemy Within (2007) by William C. Dietz, and Hitman: Damnation (2012) by Raymond Benson; a comic book miniseries, Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman, which serves as a prequel to the games; and two negatively received theatrical films, Hitman (2007) and Hitman: Agent 47 (2015), which share no narrative connections with the game series."
Lynching is an extrajudicial killing by a group.
"It is most often used to characterize informal public executions by a mob in order to punish an alleged transgressor, punish a convicted transgressor, or intimidate."
"It can also be an extreme form of informal group social control, and it is often conducted with the display of a public spectacle (often in the form of hanging) for maximum intimidation."
"Instances of lynchings and similar mob violence can be found in every society.In the United States, where the word for ""lynching"" likely originated, lynchings of African Americans became frequent in the South during the period after the Reconstruction era, especially during the nadir of American race relations."
"Sugar is the generic name for sweet-tasting, soluble carbohydrates, many of which are used in food."
"Simple sugars, also called monosaccharides, include glucose, fructose, and galactose."
"Compound sugars, also called disaccharides or double sugars, are molecules made of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic bond."
"Common examples are sucrose (glucose + fructose), lactose (glucose + galactose), and maltose (two molecules of glucose)."
"Table sugar, granulated sugar, and regular sugar refer to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose."
"In the body, compound sugars are hydrolysed into simple sugars."
"Longer chains of monosaccharides (>2) are not regarded as sugars, and are called oligosaccharides or polysaccharides."
"Starch is a glucose polymer found in plants, and is the most abundant source of energy in human food."
"Some other chemical substances, such as glycerol and sugar alcohols, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar."
Sugars are found in the tissues of most plants.
Honey and fruit are abundant natural sources of simple sugars.
"Sucrose is especially concentrated in sugarcane and sugar beet, making them ideal for efficient commercial extraction to make refined sugar."
"In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion tonnes."
Maltose may be produced by malting grain.
Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants.
"It can only be found in milk, including human breast milk, and in some dairy products."
"A cheap source of sugar is corn syrup, industrially produced by converting corn starch into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose."
Sucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g.
"cookies and cakes), is sometimes added to commercially available processed food and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g."
toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g.
coffee and tea).
"The average person consumes about 24 kilograms (53 lb) of sugar each year, with North and South Americans consuming up to 50 kilograms (110 lb) and Africans consuming under 20 kilograms (44 lb).As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to human health."
"Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tooth decay."
"Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar."
"In 2015, the World Health Organization recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total energy intake."
"A  hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted ""head"" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object."
"This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock."
"Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications."
"Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong)."
"Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with an secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook."
"Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc—downward to add kinetic energy to the impact—pivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring)."
"War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets."
Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes.
"Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip."
"The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic."
"Ubiquitous in framing, the claw hammer has a ""claw"" to pull nails out of wood, and is commonly found in an inventory of household tools in North America."
"Other types of hammer vary in shape, size, and structure, depending on their purposes."
"Hammers used in many trades include sledgehammers, mallets, and ball-peen hammers."
"Although most hammers are hand tools, powered hammers, such as steam hammers and trip hammers, are used to deliver forces beyond the capacity of the human arm."
"There are over 40 different types of hammers that have many different types of uses.For hand hammers, the grip of the shaft is an important consideration."
"Many forms of hammering by hand are heavy work, and perspiration can lead to slippage from the hand, turning a hammer into a dangerous or destructive uncontrolled projectile."
"Steel is highly elastic and transmits shock and vibration; steel is also a good conductor of heat, making it unsuitable for contact with bare skin in frigid conditions."
"Modern hammers with steel shafts are almost invariably clad with a synthetic polymer to improve grip, dampen vibration, and to provide thermal insulation."
A suitably contoured handle is also an important aid in providing a secure grip during heavy use.
"Traditional wooden handles were reasonably good in all regards, but lack strength and durability compared to steel, and there are safety issues with wooden handles if the head becomes loose on the shaft."
"The high elasticity of the steel head is important in energy transfer, especially when used in conjunction with an equally elastic anvil."
"In terms of human physiology, many uses of the hammer involve coordinated ballistic movements under intense muscular forces which must be planned in advance at the neuromuscular level, as they occur too rapidly for conscious adjustment in flight."
"For this reason, accurate striking at speed requires more practice than a tapping movement to the same target area."
"It has been suggested that the cognitive demands for pre-planning, sequencing and accurate timing associated with the related ballistic movements of throwing, clubbing, and hammering precipitated aspects of brain evolution in early hominids."
"A trench is a type of excavation or in the ground that is generally deeper than it is wide (as opposed to a wider gully, or ditch), and narrow compared with its length (as opposed to a simple hole or pit).In geology, trenches result from erosion by rivers or by geological movement of tectonic plates."
"In civil engineering, trenches are often created to install underground utilities such as gas, water, power and communication lines."
"In construction, trenches are dug for foundations of buildings, retaining walls and dams, and for cut-and-cover construction of tunnels."
"In archaeology, the ""trench method"" is used for searching and excavating ancient ruins or to dig into strata of sedimented material."
"In geotechnical engineering, trenches serve for locating faults and investigating deep soil properties."
"In trench warfare, soldiers occupy trenches to protect them against weapons fire."
"Trenches are dug by use of manual tools such as shovels and pickaxes, or by heavy equipment such as backhoes, trenchers and excavators."
"For deep trenches, the instability of steep earthen walls requires engineering and safety techniques such as shoring."
"Trenches are usually considered temporary structures to be backfilled with soil after construction, or abandoned after use."
Some trenches are stabilized using durable materials such as concrete to create open passages such as canals and sunken roadways.
"A cross is a geometrical figure consisting of two intersecting lines or bars, usually perpendicular to each other."
The lines usually run vertically and horizontally.
"A cross of oblique lines, in the shape of the Latin letter X, is termed a saltire in heraldic terminology."
The cross in its various shapes and forms was a symbol of various beliefs.
In pre-Christian times it was a pagan religious symbol throughout Europe and western Asia.
"In ancient times, the effigy of a man hanging on a cross was set up in the fields to protect the crops."
"The cross was even considered a male symbol of the phallic Tree of Life; thus it often appeared in conjunction with the female-genital circle or oval, to signify the sacred marriage, as in Egyptian amulet Nefer with male cross and female orb, considered as an amulet of blessedness, a charm of sexual harmony."
"Paint is any pigmented liquid, liquefiable, or solid mastic composition that, after application to a substrate in a thin layer, converts to a solid film."
"It is most commonly used to protect, color, or provide texture to objects."
"Paint can be made or purchased in many colors—and in many different types, such as watercolor or synthetic."
"Paint is typically stored, sold, and applied as a liquid, but most types dry into a solid."
Most paints are either oil-based or water-based and each has distinct characteristics.
"For one, it is illegal in most municipalities to discard oil-based paint down household drains or sewers."
Clean-up solvents are also different for water-based paint than they are for oil-based paint.
Water-based paints and oil-based paints will cure differently based on the outside ambient temperature of the object being painted (such as a house.)
"Usually, the object being painted must be over 10 °C (50 °F), although some manufacturers of external paints/primers claim they can be applied when temperatures are as low as 2 °C (35 °F)."
An auto clicker is a type of software or macro that can be used to automate the clicking of a mouse on a computer screen element and click faster than intended.
"Clickers can be triggered to repeat input that was recorded earlier, or generated from various current settings."
Auto clickers can be as simple as a program that simulates mouse clicking.
This type of auto clicker is fairly generic and will often work alongside any other computer program running at the time and acting as though a physical mouse button is pressed.
"More complex auto clickers can similarly be as general, but often are custom-made for use with one particular program and involve memory reading."
"Such auto clickers may allow the user to automate most or all mouse functions, as well as simulate a full set of keyboard inputs."
Custom-made auto clickers may have a narrower scope than a generic auto clicker.
"Auto clickers also called automation software programs, may also have features enabling response conditional reactions, as well as a keyboard."
"A ship's company comprises all officers, non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel aboard a naval vessel."
"The size of the ship's company (the complement) is the number of people on board, excluding civilians and guests."
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument.
"Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator."
"The strike may be made by an internal ""clapper"" or ""uvula"", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell)."
"Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials."
This depends on the function.
"Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal."
"Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower."
"Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters."
"Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services."
"Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom."
The study of bells is called campanology.
"An image (from Latin: imago) is an artifact that depicts visual perception, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject—usually a physical object—and thus provides a depiction of it."
"In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s)."
"A pictorial script is a writing system that employs images as symbols for various semantic entities, rather than the abstract signs used by alphabets."
"In its most general sense, the term ""world"" refers to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything that is."
The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields.
"Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a ""plurality of worlds""."
Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of many parts.
"In scientific cosmology the world or universe is commonly defined as ""[t]he totality of all space and time; all that is, has been, and will be""."
"Theories of modality, on the other hand, talk of possible worlds as complete and consistent ways how things could have been."
"Phenomenology, starting from the horizon of co-given objects present in the periphery of every experience, defines the world as the biggest horizon or the ""horizon of all horizons""."
"In philosophy of mind, the world is commonly contrasted with the mind as that which is represented by the mind."
"Theology conceptualizes the world in relation to God, for example, as God's creation, as identical to God or as the two being interdependent."
"In religions, there is often a tendency to downgrade the material or sensory world in favor of a spiritual world to be sought through religious practice."
"A comprehensive representation of the world and our place in it, as is commonly found in religions, is known as a worldview."
Cosmogony is the field that studies the origin or creation of the world while eschatology refers to the science or doctrine of the last things or of the end of the world.
"In various contexts, the term ""world"" takes a more restricted meaning associated, for example, with the Earth and all life on it, with humanity as a whole or with an international or intercontinental scope."
"In this sense, world history refers to the history of humanity as a whole or world politics is the discipline of political science studying issues that transcend nations and continents."
"Other examples include terms such as ""world religion"", ""world language"", ""world government"", ""world war"", ""world population"", ""world economy"" or ""world championship""."
"Internal control, as defined by accounting and auditing, is a process for assuring of an organization's objectives in operational effectiveness and efficiency, reliable financial reporting, and compliance with laws, regulations and policies."
"A broad concept, internal control involves everything that controls risks to an organization."
"It is a means by which an organization's resources are directed, monitored, and measured."
"It plays an important role in detecting and preventing fraud and protecting the organization's resources, both physical (e.g., machinery and property) and intangible (e.g., reputation or intellectual property such as trademarks)."
"At the organizational level, internal control objectives relate to the reliability of financial reporting, timely feedback on the achievement of operational or strategic goals, and compliance with laws and regulations."
"At the specific transaction level, internal controls refers to the actions taken to achieve a specific objective (e.g., how to ensure the organization's payments to third parties are for valid services rendered.)"
"Internal control procedures reduce process variation, leading to more predictable outcomes."
"Internal control is a key element of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 and the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which required improvements in internal control in United States public corporations."
Internal controls within business entities are also referred to as operational controls.
"The main controls in place are sometimes referred to as ""key financial controls"" (KFCs)."
"Naïve art is usually defined as visual art that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, art history, technique, perspective, ways of seeing)."
"When this aesthetic is emulated by a trained artist, the result is sometimes called primitivism, pseudo-naïve art, or faux naïve art.Unlike folk art, naïve art does not necessarily derive from a distinct popular cultural context or tradition;  indeed, at least in the advanced economies and since the Printing Revolution, awareness of the local fine art tradition has been inescapable, as it diffused through popular prints and other media."
"Naïve artists are aware of ""fine art"" conventions such as graphical perspective and compositional conventions, but are unable to fully use them, or choose not to."
"By contrast, outsider art (art brut) denotes works from a similar context but which have only minimal contact with the mainstream art world."
"Naïve art is recognized, and often imitated, for its childlike simplicity and frankness."
Paintings of this kind typically have a flat rendering style with a rudimentary expression of perspective.
"One particularly influential painter of ""naïve art"" was Henri Rousseau (1844–1910), a French Post-Impressionist who was discovered by Pablo Picasso."
"The definition of the term, and its ""borders"" with neighbouring terms such as folk art and outsider art, has been a matter of some controversy."
"Naïve art is a term usually used for the forms of fine art, such as paintings and sculptures, but made by a self-taught artist, while objects with a practical use come under folk art."
But this distinction has been disputed.
"Another term that may be used, especially of paintings and architecture, is ""provincial"", essentially used for work by artists who had received some conventional training, but whose work unintentionally falls short of metropolitan or court standards."
"A bra,  short for  brassiere or brassière (US: , UK:  or ; French: [bʁasjɛʁ]), is a form-fitting undergarment typically designed to support or cover a woman's breasts."
"Bras are designed for a variety of purposes, including general breast support, enhancing or diminishing the appearance of breast size and/or shape, creating cleavage, or other aesthetic or practical purposes."
"Swimsuits, camisoles, and backless dresses may have built-in breast support with supportive bra cups."
Nursing bras are designed to facilitate breastfeeding.
"Some people have a medical and surgical need for brassieres, but most wear them for fashion or cultural reasons."
Bras have gained importance beyond their mere functionality.
"Women's choices about what kind of bra to wear are consciously and unconsciously affected by social perceptions of the ideal female body shape, which changes over time."
Bras have become fashion items and cultural statements that are sometimes purposely revealed by the wearer or even worn as outerwear.
"Saly (also called Sali or Saly Portudal) is a seaside resort area in Thiès Region on the Petite Côte of Senegal, south of Dakar."
It is the top tourist destination in all of West Africa and has the status of a commune.
Blink of an Eye is the fourth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Michael McDonald.
"It was released on August 3, 1993, on the label Reprise, three years after his previous album, Take It to Heart."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"The number π (; spelled out as ""pi"") is a mathematical constant, approximately equal to 3.14159."
"It is defined in Euclidean geometry as the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, and also has various equivalent definitions."
The number appears in many formulas in all areas of mathematics and physics.
The earliest known use of the Greek letter π to represent the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter was by the Welsh mathematician William Jones in 1706.
"It is also referred to as Archimedes's constant.Being an irrational number, π cannot be expressed as a common fraction, although fractions such as 22/7 are commonly used to approximate it."
"Equivalently, its decimal representation never ends and never settles into a permanently repeating pattern."
"Its decimal (or other base) digits appear to be randomly distributed, and are conjectured to satisfy a specific kind of statistical randomness."
It is known that π is a transcendental number: it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients.
The transcendence of π implies that it is impossible to solve the ancient challenge of squaring the circle with a compass and straightedge.
"Ancient civilizations, including the Egyptians and Babylonians, required fairly accurate approximations of π for practical computations."
"Around 250 BC, the Greek mathematician Archimedes created an algorithm to approximate π with arbitrary accuracy."
"In the 5th century AD, Chinese mathematics approximated π to seven digits, while Indian mathematics made a five-digit approximation, both using geometrical techniques."
"The first computational formula for π, based on infinite series, was discovered a millennium later, when the Madhava–Leibniz series was discovered by the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics, documented in the Yuktibhāṣā, written around 1530.The invention of calculus soon led to the calculation of hundreds of digits of π, enough for all practical scientific computations."
"Nevertheless, in the 20th and 21st centuries, mathematicians and computer scientists have pursued new approaches that, when combined with increasing computational power, extended the decimal representation of π to many trillions of digits."
"The primary motivation for these computations is as a test case to develop efficient algorithms to calculate numeric series, as well as the quest to break records."
The extensive calculations involved have also been used to test supercomputers and high-precision multiplication algorithms.
"Because its most elementary definition relates to the circle, π is found in many formulae in trigonometry and geometry, especially those concerning circles, ellipses, and spheres."
"In more modern mathematical analysis, the number is instead defined using the spectral properties of the real number system, as an eigenvalue or a period, without any reference to geometry."
"It appears therefore in areas of mathematics and sciences having little to do with the geometry of circles, such as number theory and statistics, as well as in almost all areas of physics."
The ubiquity of π makes it one of the most widely known mathematical constants—both inside and outside the scientific community.
"Several books devoted to π have been published, and record-setting calculations of the digits of π often result in news headlines."
Tissue typing is a procedure in which the tissues of a prospective donor and recipient are tested for compatibility prior to transplantation.
Mismatched donor and recipient tissues can lead to rejection of the tissues.
There are multiple methods of tissue typing.
"Starting in the Middle Ages, a squire was the shield- or armour-bearer of a knight.Use of the term evolved over time."
"Initially, a squire was a knight's apprentice."
"Later, a village leader or a lord of the manor might be called a squire, and still later, the term was applied to members of the landed gentry."
"In contemporary American usage, squire is the title given to justices of the peace or similar local dignitaries.Squire is a shortened version of the word esquire,  from the Old French escuier (modern French écuyer), itself derived from the Late Latin scutarius (""shield bearer""), in medieval or Old English  a scutifer."
"The Classical Latin equivalent was armiger (""arms bearer"")."
Corn smut is a plant disease caused by the pathogenic fungus Ustilago maydis that causes smut on maize and teosinte.
The fungus forms galls on all above-ground parts of corn species.
"It is edible, and is known in Mexico as the delicacy huitlacoche; which is eaten, usually as a filling, in quesadillas and other tortilla-based foods, and in soups."
"Exoticism (from 'exotic') is a trend in European art and design, whereby artists became fascinated with ideas and styles from distant regions and drew inspiration from them."
This often involved surrounding foreign cultures with mystique and fantasy which owed more to European culture than to the exotic cultures themselves: this process of glamorisation and stereotyping is called 'exoticisation'.
"Gaultheria shallon is an evergreen shrub in the heather family (Ericaceae), native to western North America."
"In English, it is known as salal, shallon, or simply gaultheria in Britain."
"In accounting, the controlling account (also known as an adjustment or control account) is an account in the general ledger for which a corresponding subsidiary ledger has been created."
The subsidiary ledger allows for tracking transactions within the controlling account in more detail.
"Individual transactions are posted both to the controlling account and the corresponding subsidiary ledger, and the totals for both are compared when preparing a trial balance to ensure accuracy."
"For example, ""accounts receivable"" is the controlling account for the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger."
"In this subsidiary ledger, each credit customer has their own account with its own balance."
"Thus, while the ""accounts receivable balance"" can report how much the company is owed, the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger can report how much is owed from each credit customer."
"Other examples of controlling accounts and their subsidiary ledgers include ""accounts payable"" (accounts payable subsidiary ledger) and ""equipment"" (equipment subsidiary ledger).In common use, control accounts refer to those that would, under ideal circumstances, balance to zero."
"For example, an inventory control account will hold the balance amount between a stock account updated by stock transactions on the balance sheet and the value of stock on hand multiplied by its unit cost."
Ideally these would be the same value but rarely are.
"Reasons for discrepancies include stock losses and gains yet to be ""journaled"" and the control account measures the differences and provides financial visibility and control of the value of those."
"If the discrepancy is significant, then actions such as stock counts can be triggered in order to validate stock and correct the balance sheet and clear the control account."
"Other examples would be the ""goods received not invoiced"" account."
"Allium ursinum, known as wild garlic, ramsons, wild cowleek, cowlic, buckrams, broad-leaved garlic, wood garlic, bear leek or bear's garlic, is a bulbous perennial flowering plant in the amaryllis family Amaryllidaceae."
"It is native to Europe and Asia, where it grows in moist woodland."
"It is a wild relative of onion and garlic, all belonging to the same genus, Allium."
There are two recognized subspecies: A. ursinum subsp.
ursinum and A. ursinum subsp.
ucranicum.
"A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural."
"Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources."
"Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature."
"The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery."
"At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes."
"Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to ""enchanted"" or ""magical""."
"It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy."
A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms.
"Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food."
"Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps."
"Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities."
"In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras."
The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally."
"In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly orange yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal."
"Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element."
It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.
"Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits."
"It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite."
"Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides)."
"Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion."
"Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term acid test."
"Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating."
"Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction."
"A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history."
"In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971."
"A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020."
This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft).
"The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
"Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use)."
"Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration."
Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.
"As of 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year."
"A cup is an open-top container used to hold or cold liquids for pouring or drinking; while mainly used for drinking, it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains, salt)."
"Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments."
"Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations."
Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g.
"teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g."
"at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals),or for decoration."
A name is a term used for identification by an external observer.
"They can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context."
The entity identified by a name is called its referent.
"A personal name identifies, not necessarily uniquely, a specific individual human."
"The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning as well) and is, when consisting of only one word, a proper noun."
"Other nouns are sometimes called ""common names"" or (obsolete) ""general names""."
"A name can be given to a person, place, or thing; for example, parents can give their child a name or a scientist can give an element a name."
Light or visible light is electromagnetic radiation within the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is perceived by the human eye.
"Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700 nanometres (nm), between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths).In physics, the term ""light"" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not."
"In this sense, gamma rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light."
"The primary properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization."
"Its speed in a vacuum, 299 792 458 metres a second (m/s), is one of the fundamental constants of nature."
"Like all types of electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and particles."
"The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics."
The main source of light on Earth is the Sun.
"Historically, another important source of light for humans has been fire, from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps."
"With the development of electric lights and power systems, electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight."
"Wool is the textile fibre obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, hide and fur clothing from bison, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids.Wool consists of protein together with a small percentage of lipids."
"In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from cotton, which is mainly cellulose."
"A clothes line or washing line is any type of rope, cord, or twine that has been stretched between two points (e.g."
"two sticks), outside or indoors, above the level of the ground."
"Clothing that has recently been  washed is hung along the line to dry, using clothes pegs or clothespins."
"Washing lines are attached either from a post or a wall, and are frequently located in back gardens, or on balconies."
Longer washing lines often have props holding up sections in the middle due to the weight of the usually wet clothing.
"More elaborate rotary washing lines save space and are typically retractable and square or triangular in shape, with multiple lines being used (such as the Hills Hoist from Australia)."
"Some can be folded up when not in use (although there is a very minor hazard of getting fingers caught, so there is usually a safety button)."
"In Scotland, many tenement buildings have a ""drying green"", which is a communal area predominantly used for clothes lines – it may also be used as a recreational space - as well as a clothes horse connected to a pulley system inside which can be used in the frequently cold winter weather."
"The Revenue Act of 1913, also known as the Underwood Tariff or the Underwood-Simmons Act (ch."
"16, 38 Stat."
"114), re-established a federal income tax in the United States and substantially lowered tariff rates."
"The act was sponsored by Representative Oscar Underwood, passed by the 63rd United States Congress, and signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson."
"Wilson and other members of the Democratic Party had long seen high tariffs as equivalent to unfair taxes on consumers, and tariff reduction was President Wilson's first priority upon taking office."
"Following the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, Democratic leaders agreed to seek passage of a major bill that would dramatically lower tariffs and implement an income tax."
"Underwood quickly shepherded the revenue bill through the House of Representatives, but the bill won approval in the United States Senate only after extensive lobbying by the Wilson administration."
"Wilson signed the bill into law on October 3, 1913."
The Revenue Act of 1913 lowered average tariff rates from 40 percent to 26 percent.
"It also established a one percent tax on income above $3,000 per year; the tax affected approximately three percent of the population."
"A separate provision established a corporate tax of one percent, superseding a previous tax that had only applied to corporations with net incomes greater than $5,000 per year."
"Though a Republican-controlled Congress would later raise tariff rates, the Revenue Act of 1913 marked an important shift in federal revenue policy, as government revenue would increasingly rely on income taxes rather than tariff duties."
"Weather is the state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy."
"On Earth, most weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the troposphere, just below the stratosphere."
"Weather refers to day-to-day temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time."
"When used without qualification, ""weather"" is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth."
"Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature, and moisture differences between one place and another."
"These differences can occur due to the Sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude."
"The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley cell, the Ferrel cell, the polar cell, and the jet stream."
"Weather systems in the middle latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet streamflow."
"Because Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane (called the ecliptic), sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year."
"On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C (−40 °F to 104 °F) annually."
"Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change."
Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences.
"Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, as most atmospheric heating is due to contact with the Earth's surface while radiative losses to space are mostly constant."
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location.
"Earth's weather system is a chaotic system; as a result, small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole."
"Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout history, and there is evidence that human activities such as agriculture and industry have modified weather patterns
Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth."
"A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years."
"However, the weather is not limited to planetary bodies."
"A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System."
The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.
Jungle warfare is a term used to cover the special techniques needed for military units to survive and fight in jungle terrain.
"It has been the topic of extensive study by military strategists, and was an important part of the planning for both sides in many conflicts, including World War II and the Vietnam War."
The jungle has a variety of effects on military operations.
"Dense vegetation can limit lines of sight and arcs of fire, but can also provide ample opportunity for camouflage and plenty of material with which to build fortifications."
"Jungle terrain, often without good roads, can be inaccessible to vehicles and so makes logistical supply and transport difficult, which in turn places a premium on air mobility."
"The problems of transport make engineering resources important as they are needed to improve roads, build bridges and airfields, and improve water supplies."
"Jungle environments can also be inherently unhealthy, with various tropical diseases that have to be prevented or treated by medical services."
"Likewise the terrain can make it difficult to deploy armoured forces, or any other kind of forces on any large scale."
Successful jungle fighting emphasises effective small unit tactics and leadership.
"Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits whose main preserving agent is sugar and sometimes acid, often stored in glass jars and used as a condiment or spread."
"There are many varieties of fruit preserves globally, distinguished by method of preparation, type of fruit used, and place in a meal."
"Sweet fruit preserves such as jams, jellies and marmalades are often eaten at breakfast on bread or as an ingredient of a pastry or dessert, whereas more savory and acidic preserves made from ""vegetable fruits"" such as tomato, squash or zucchini, are eaten alongside savoury foods such as cheese, cold meats, and curries."
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) is a name used by various paramilitary organisations in Ireland throughout the 20th and the 21st centuries.
"Organisations going by this name have been dedicated to irredentism through Irish republicanism, the belief that all of Ireland should be an independent republic free from British rule.The original Irish Republican Army (1919–1922), often now referred to as the ""old IRA"", was raised in 1917 from members of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, later reinforced by Irishmen, formerly in the British Army in World War I, who returned to Ireland to fight against Britain in the Irish War of Independence."
"In Irish law, this IRA was the army of the revolutionary Irish Republic as declared by its parliament, Dáil Éireann, in 1919."
"In the century that followed, the original IRA was reorganised, changed and split on multiple occasions, to such a degree that many subsequent paramilitary organisations have been known by that title – most notably the Provisional Irish Republican Army which was a key participant during the Troubles."
"The contemporary IRA organisations each claim the sole right to use that name, as they each insist they are the only legitimate descendants of the original IRA."
Nick is a masculine given name.
"It is  also often encountered as a short form (hypocorism) of the given names Nicholas, Nicola,  Nicolas, Nikola, Nicolai or Nicodemus."
It may refer to:
"The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake."
"The Earth has around  620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline."
"Coasts are important zones in natural ecosystems, often home to a wide range of biodiversity."
"On land, they harbor important ecosystems such as freshwater or estuarine wetlands, which are important for bird populations and other terrestrial animals."
"In wave-protected areas they harbor saltmarshes, mangroves or seagrasses, all of which can provide nursery habitat for finfish, shellfish, and other aquatic species."
Rocky shores are usually found along exposed coasts and provide habitat for a wide range of sessile animals (e.g.
"mussels, starfish, barnacles) and various kinds of seaweeds."
"Along tropical coasts with clear, nutrient-poor water, coral reefs can often be found between depths of 1 – 50 m.
According to a United Nations atlas, 44% of all people live within 150 km (93 mi) of the sea."
"Because of their importance in society and high concentration of population, the coast is important for major parts of the global food and economic system, and they provide many ecosystem services to humankind."
"For example, important human activities happen in port cities."
"Coastal fisheries (commercial, recreational, and subsistence) and aquaculture are major economic activities and create jobs, livelihoods, and protein for the majority of coastal human populations."
Other coastal spaces like beaches and seaside resorts generate large revenues through tourism.
Coastal ecosystems can also provide protection against sea level rise and tsunamis.
"In many countries, mangroves are the primary source of wood for fuel (e.g."
charcoal) and building material.
"Coastal ecosystems like mangroves and seagrasses have a much higher capacity for carbon sequestration than many terrestrial ecosystems, and as such can play a critical role in the near-future to help mitigate climate change effects by uptake of atmospheric anthropogenic carbon dioxide."
"However, the economic importance of coasts makes many of these communities vulnerable to climate change which causes increases in extreme weather and sea level rise, and related issues such as coastal erosion, saltwater intrusion and coastal flooding."
"Other coastal issues, such as marine pollution, marine debris, coastal development, and marine ecosystem destruction, further complicate the human uses of the coast and threaten coastal ecosystems."
"The interactive effects of climate change, habitat destruction, overfishing and water pollution (especially eutrophication) have led to the demise of coastal ecosystem around the globe."
"This has resulted in population collapse of fisheries stocks, loss of biodiversity, increased invasion of alien species, and loss of heathy habitats."
"International attention to these issues has been captured in Sustainable Development Goal 14 ""Life Below Water"" which sets goals for international policy focused on preserving coastal ecosystems and supporting more sustainable economic practices for coastal communities."
"Likewise, the United Nations has declared 2021-2030 the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, but restoration of coastal ecosystems has received insufficient attention.Because coasts are constantly changing, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined; this measurement challenge is called the coastline paradox."
The term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur.
"Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East, West, and Gulf Coast of the United States.)"
"Coasts with a narrow continental shelf that are close to the open ocean are called pelagic coast, while other coasts are more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay."
"A shore, on the other hand, may refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (sea shore) and lakes (lake shore)."
"A sneeze (also known as sternutation) is a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through the nose and mouth, usually caused by foreign particles irritating the nasal mucosa."
"A sneeze expels air forcibly from the mouth and nose in an explosive, spasmodic involuntary action."
This action allows for mucus to escape through the nasal cavity.
"Sneezing is possibly linked to sudden exposure to bright light, sudden change (fall) in temperature, breeze of cold air, a particularly full stomach, exposure to allergens, or viral infection."
"Because sneezes can spread disease through infectious aerosol droplets, it is recommended to cover one's mouth and nose with the forearm, the inside of the elbow, a tissue or a handkerchief while sneezing."
"In addition to covering the mouth, looking down is also recommended in order to change the direction of the droplets spread and avoid high concentration in the human breathing heights."
The function of sneezing is to expel mucus containing foreign particles or irritants and cleanse the nasal cavity.
"During a sneeze, the soft palate and palatine uvula depress while the back of the tongue elevates to partially close the passage to the mouth, creating a venturi (similar to a carburetor) due to Bernoulli's principle so that air ejected from the lungs is accelerated through the mouth and thus creating a low pressure point at the back of the nose."
This way air is forced in through the front of the nose and the expelled mucus and contaminants are launched out the mouth.
"Sneezing with the mouth closed does expel mucus through the nose but is not recommended because it creates a very high pressure in the head and is potentially harmful, blocking a sneeze entirely may even prove fatal.Sneezing cannot occur during sleep due to REM atonia – a bodily state where motor neurons are not stimulated and reflex signals are not relayed to the brain."
"Sufficient external stimulants, however, may cause a person to wake from sleep to sneeze, but any sneezing occurring afterwards would take place with a partially awake status at minimum."
"A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface."
"On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater."
"For example, a mid-ocean ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates."
"Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America."
"Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth."
"This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example."
Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.
Large eruptions can affect atmospheric temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the Sun and cool the Earth's  troposphere.
"Historically, large volcanic eruptions have been followed by volcanic winters which have caused catastrophic famines."
A comptroller is a management-level position responsible for supervising the quality of accounting and financial reporting of an organization.
"A financial comptroller is a senior-level executive who acts as the head of accounting, and oversees the preparation of financial reports, such as balance sheets and income statements."
"In most Commonwealth countries, the comptroller general, auditor general, or comptroller and auditor general is the external auditor of the budget execution of the government and of government-owned companies."
"Typically, the independent institution headed by the comptroller general is a member of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions."
"In American government, the comptroller is effectively the chief financial officer of a public body."
"In business management, the comptroller is closer to a chief audit executive, holding a senior role in internal audit functions."
"Generally, the title encompasses a variety of responsibilities, from overseeing accounting and monitoring internal controls to countersigning on expenses and commitments."
"Silver is a chemical element with the symbol Ag (from the Latin argentum, derived from the Proto-Indo-European h₂erǵ: ""shiny"" or ""white"") and atomic number 47."
"A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal."
"The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (""native silver""), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite."
"Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining."
Silver has long been valued as a precious metal.
"Silver metal is used in many bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal."
"Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as ""0.940 fine""."
"As one of the seven metals of antiquity, silver has had an enduring role in most human cultures."
"Other than in currency and as an investment medium (coins and bullion), silver is used in solar panels, water filtration, jewellery, ornaments, high-value tableware and utensils (hence the term ""silverware""), in electrical contacts and conductors, in specialized mirrors, window coatings, in catalysis of chemical reactions, as a colorant in stained glass, and in specialized confectionery."
Its compounds are used in photographic and X-ray film.
"Dilute solutions of silver nitrate and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides (oligodynamic effect), added to bandages, wound-dressings, catheters, and other medical instruments."
"Landscape painting, also known as landscape art, is the depiction of natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view—with its elements arranged into a coherent composition."
"In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form an important part of the work."
"Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition."
"Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when there is already a sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects."
"Two main traditions spring from Western painting and Chinese art, going back well over a thousand years in both cases."
"The recognition of a spiritual element in landscape art is present from its beginnings in East Asian art, drawing on Daoism and other philosophical traditions, but in the West only becomes explicit with Romanticism."
"Landscape views in art may be entirely imaginary, or copied from reality with varying degrees of accuracy."
"If the primary purpose of a picture is to depict an actual, specific place, especially including buildings prominently, it is called a topographical view."
"Such views, extremely common as prints in the West, are often seen as inferior to fine art landscapes, although the distinction is not always meaningful; similar prejudices existed in Chinese art, where literati painting usually depicted imaginary views, while professional artists painted real views.The word ""landscape"" entered the modern English language as landskip (variously spelt), an anglicization of the Dutch landschap, around the start of the 17th century, purely as a term for works of art, with its first use as a word for a painting in 1598."
"Within a few decades it was used to describe vistas in poetry, and eventually as a term for real views."
"However the cognate term landscaef or landskipe for a cleared patch of land had existed in Old English, though it is not recorded from Middle English."
"A hydrofoil is a lifting surface, or foil, that operates in water."
They are similar in appearance and purpose to aerofoils used by aeroplanes.
Boats that use hydrofoil technology are also simply termed hydrofoils.
"As a hydrofoil craft gains speed, the hydrofoils lift the boat's hull out of the water, decreasing drag and allowing greater speeds."
"Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by their lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults."
All ten extant salamander families are grouped together under the order Urodela.
"Salamander diversity is highest in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic realm, with some species present in the Neotropical realm."
"Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species have fewer digits and others lack hind limbs."
"Their permeable skin usually makes them reliant on habitats in or near water or other cool, damp places."
"Some salamander species are fully aquatic throughout their lives, some take to the water intermittently, and others are entirely terrestrial as adults."
They are capable of regenerating lost limbs as well as other damaged parts of their bodies.
"Researchers hope to reverse engineer the remarkable regenerative processes for potential human medical applications, such as brain and spinal cord injury treatment or preventing harmful scarring during heart surgery recovery.Members of the family Salamandridae are mostly known as newts and lack the costal grooves along the sides of their bodies typical of other groups."
The skin of some species contains the powerful poison tetrodotoxin; these salamanders tend to be slow-moving and have bright warning coloration to advertise their toxicity.
"Salamanders typically lay eggs in water and have aquatic larvae, but great variation occurs in their lifecycles."
Some species in harsh environments reproduce while still in the larval state.
"1 (one, also called unit, and unity) is a number and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals."
"It represents a single entity, the unit of counting or measurement."
"For example, a line segment of unit length is a line segment of length 1."
"In conventions of sign where zero is considered neither positive nor negative, 1 is the first and smallest positive integer."
"It is also sometimes considered the first of the infinite sequence of natural numbers, followed by 2, although by other definitions 1 is the second natural number, following 0."
"The fundamental mathematical property of 1 is to be a multiplicative identity, meaning that any number multiplied by 1 equals the same number."
Most if not all properties of 1 can be deduced from this.
"In advanced mathematics, a multiplicative identity is often denoted 1, even if it is not a number."
"1 is by convention not considered a prime number; although universally accepted today, this fact was controversial until the mid-20th century."
"The unique mathematical properties of the number have led to its unique uses in other fields, ranging from science to sports."
"It commonly denotes the first, leading or top thing in a group."
"A wet wipe, also known as a wet towel or a moist towelette, disposable wipe, disinfecting wipe, or a baby wipe (in specific circumstances), is a small to medium-sized moistened piece of plastic or cloth that either comes folded and individually wrapped for convenience or, in the case of dispensers, as a large roll with individual wipes that can be torn off."
Wet wipes are used for cleaning purposes like personal hygiene and household cleaning; each is a separate product depending on the chemicals added and medical or office cleaning wipes are not intended for skin hygiene.
"In 2013, owing to increasing popularity of the product in affluent countries, Consumer Reports reported that efforts to make the wipes ""flushable"" down the toilet had not entirely succeeded, according to their test."
"A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water."
"The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers."
"The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand."
Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well.
"Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India."
"Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age."
"Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world."
"These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds."
A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole.
"Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water."
"Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole."
Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic.
Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
"Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath."
A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material.
"The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor."
Water may be pumped or hand drawn.
Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided.
Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable.
Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out.
Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.
Scissors are hand-operated shearing tools.
A pair of scissors consists of a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed.
"Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire."
A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes.
"Hair-cutting shears and kitchen shears are functionally equivalent to scissors, but the larger implements tend to be called shears."
Hair-cutting shears have specific blade angles ideal for cutting hair.
"Using the incorrect type of scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair."
"Kitchen shears, also known as kitchen scissors, are intended for cutting and trimming foods such as meats."
Modern scissors are often designed ergonomically with composite thermoplastic and rubber handles which enable the user to exert either a power grip or a precision grip.
"A beefsteak, often called just steak, is a flat cut of beef with parallel faces, usually cut perpendicular to the muscle fibers."
In common restaurant service a single serving has a raw mass ranging from 120 to 600 grams (4 to 21 oz).
"Beef steaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or broiled."
"The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked quickly, using dry heat, and served whole."
Less tender cuts from the chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically tenderized (cf.
cube steak).
This is a partial list of human eye diseases and disorders.
"The World Health Organization publishes a classification of known diseases and injuries, the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD-10."
This list uses that classification.
"A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural orbital period of the Moon; the words month and Moon are cognates."
"The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (""lunations"") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days."
"From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age."
"Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year."
"Natural childbirth is childbirth without routine medical interventions, particularly anesthesia."
Natural childbirth arose in opposition to the techno-medical model of childbirth that has recently gained popularity in industrialized societies.
"Natural childbirth attempts to minimize medical intervention, particularly the use of anesthetic medications and surgical interventions such as episiotomies, forceps and ventouse deliveries and caesarean sections."
"Natural childbirth may occur during a physician or midwife attended hospital birth, a midwife attended homebirth, or an unassisted birth."
"The term ""natural childbirth"" was coined by obstetrician Grantly Dick-Read upon publication of his book Natural Childbirth in the 1930s, which was followed by the 1942 Childbirth Without Fear."
Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties.
"It borders Greater London to the north-west, Surrey to the west and East Sussex to the south-west, and Essex to the north across the estuary of the River Thames; it faces the French department of Pas-de-Calais across the Strait of Dover."
The county town is Maidstone.
"It is the fifth most populous county in England, the most populous non-Metropolitan county and the most populous of the home counties."
"Kent was one of the first British territories to be settled by Germanic tribes, most notably the Jutes, following the withdrawal of the Romans."
"Canterbury Cathedral in Kent, the oldest cathedral in England, has been the seat of the Archbishops of Canterbury since the conversion of England to Christianity that began in the 6th century with Saint Augustine."
Rochester Cathedral in Medway is England's second-oldest cathedral.
"Located between London and the Strait of Dover, which separates England from mainland Europe, Kent has been the setting for both conflict and diplomacy, including the Battle of Britain in World War II and the Leeds Castle peace talks of 1978 and 2004."
England relied on the county's ports to provide warships through much of its history; the Cinque Ports in the 10th–14th centuries and Chatham Dockyard in the 16th–20th centuries were of particular importance.
France can be seen clearly in fine weather from Folkestone and the White Cliffs of Dover.
Hills in the form of the North Downs and the Greensand Ridge span the length of the county and in the Vale of Holmesdale in between and to the south are most of the county's 26 castles.
"Kent's economy is greatly diversified: agriculture, haulage, logistics and tourism are major industries."
"Because of its relative abundance of fruit-growing and hop gardens, Kent is known as ""The Garden of England""."
"In northwest Kent, industries include extraction of aggregate building materials, printing and scientific research."
Coal mining has also played its part in Kent's industrial heritage.
Large parts of Kent are within the London commuter belt and its strong transport connections to the capital and the nearby continent make Kent a high-income county.
Twenty-eight per cent of the county forms part of two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the North Downs and The High Weald.
An oil well is a boring in the Earth that is designed to bring petroleum oil hydrocarbons to the surface.
Usually some natural gas is released as associated petroleum gas along with the oil.
A well that is designed to produce only gas may be termed a gas well.
Wells are created by drilling down into an oil or gas reserve that is then mounted with an extraction device such as a pumpjack which allows extraction from the reserve.
"Creating the wells can be an expensive process, costing at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, and costing much more when in hard to reach areas, i.e."
when creating offshore oil platforms.
"The process of modern drilling for wells first started in the 19th century, but was made more efficient with advances to oil drilling rigs during the 20th century."
"Wells are frequently sold or exchanged between different oil and gas companies as an asset – in large part because during falls in price of oil and gas, a well may be unproductive, but if prices rise, even low production wells may be economically valuable."
"Moreover new methods, such as hydraulic fracturing (a process of injecting gas or liquid to force more oil or natural gas production) have made some wells viable."
"However, peak oil and climate policy to  fossil fuels has made fewer and fewer of these wells and expensive techniques viable."
"However, the large number of neglected or poorly maintained wellheads is a large environmental issue: they may leak methane emissions or other toxic emissions into local air, water or soil systems."
"This pollution often becomes worse when wells are abandoned or orphaned – where wells no longer are economically viable, and no longer are maintained by a company."
"A 2020 estimate by Reuters suggested that there were at least 29 million abandoned wells internationally, creating a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change."
"Parenting or child rearing promotes and supports the physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development of a child from infancy to adulthood."
"Parenting refers to the intricacies of raising a child and not exclusively for a biological relationship.The most common caretaker in parenting is the father or mother, or both, the biological parents of the child in question."
"However, a surrogate may be an older sibling, a step-parent, a grandparent, a legal guardian, aunt, uncle, other family members, or a family friend."
Governments and society may also have a role in child-rearing.
"In many cases, orphaned or abandoned children receive parental care from non-parent or non-blood relations."
"Others may be adopted, raised in foster care, or placed in an orphanage."
"Parenting skills vary, and a parent or surrogate with good parenting skills may be referred to as a good parent.Parenting styles vary by historical period, race/ethnicity, social class, preference, and a few other social features."
"Additionally, research supports that parental history, both in terms of attachments of varying quality and parental psychopathology, particularly in the wake of adverse experiences, can strongly influence parental sensitivity and child outcomes."
A father is the male parent of a child.
"Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children, the father may have a parental, legal, and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations."
An adoptive father is a male who has become the child's parent through the legal process of adoption.
"A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant, through sexual intercourse or sperm donation."
"A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him, such as an obligation of monetary support."
A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established.
"A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child's mother and they may form a family unit, but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child."
"The adjective ""paternal"" refers to a father and comparatively to ""maternal"" for a mother."
"The verb ""to father"" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun ""fathering""."
"Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome (female), or Y chromosome (male)."
"Related terms of endearment are dad (dada, daddy), baba, papa, pappa, papasita, (pa, pap) and pop."
A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure.
A locket is a pendant that opens to reveal a space used for storing a photograph or other small item such as a lock of hair.
"Lockets are usually given to loved ones on holidays such as Valentine's Day and occasions such as christenings, weddings and, most noticeably during the Victorian Age, funerals."
"Historically, they often opened to reveal a portrait miniature."
"Lockets are generally worn on chains around the neck and often hold a photo of the person who gave the locket, or they could form part of a charm bracelet."
"They come in many shapes such as ovals, hearts and circles and are usually made of precious metals such as gold or silver befitting their status as decorative jewellery."
"Lockets usually hold only one or two photographs, but some specially made lockets can hold up to eight."
"Some lockets have been fashioned as 'spinner' lockets, where the bail that attaches to the necklace chain is attached but not fixed to the locket itself which is free to spin."
This was a common style in the Victorian Age.
Around 1860 memento lockets started to replace mourning rings as the preferred style of mourning jewellery.Keepsake lockets can also be made with a glass pane at the front so that what is inside can be seen without opening the locket.
"Such lockets are generally used for items like locks of hair which could fall out and become lost if the locket were repeatedly opened, whereas photograph lockets are generally enclosed on all sides and the photographs are secured by pieces of clear plastic."
Another kind of locket still made was in a filigree style with a small cushion in the centre to which a few drops of perfume should be added.
Perfume lockets  were popular in eras when personal hygiene was restricted and sweet smelling perfume was used to mask the odour of a person or their companions.
"Very rare World War I- and World War II-era British and American military uniform locket buttons exist, containing miniature working compasses."
Neil is a masculine name of Irish origin.
The name is an Anglicisation of the Irish Niall which is of disputed derivation.
"The Irish name may be derived from words meaning ""cloud"", ""passionate"", ""victory"", ""honour"" or ""champion""."
"As a surname, Neil is traced back to Niall of the Nine Hostages who was an Irish king and eponymous ancestor of the Uí Néill and MacNeil kindred."
"Most authorities cite the meaning of Neil in the context of a surname as meaning ""champion""."
A wetsuit is a garment worn to provide thermal protection while wet.
"It is usually made of foamed neoprene, and is worn by surfers, divers, windsurfers, canoeists, and others engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water."
"Its purpose is to provide thermal insulation and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure, and stings from marine organisms."
It also contributes extra buoyancy.
"The insulation properties of neoprene foam depend mainly on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat."
"The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water."
"Hugh Bradner, a University of California, Berkeley physicist, invented the modern wetsuit in 1952."
"Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later spandex (also known as lycra)."
"Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing, the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside."
"Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a ""semi-dry""."
Different types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures.
"Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) ""shortie"", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood."
"The difference between a wetsuit and a dry suit is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, though good fit limits water circulation inside the suit, and between the inside and outside of the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness."
Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters.
"Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to use, but can be used where protection from lower temperatures or contaminated water is needed."
Coccinellidae () is a widespread family of small beetles ranging in size from 0.8 to 18 mm (0.03 to 0.71 in).
The family is commonly known as ladybugs in North America and ladybirds in Great Britain and other parts of the English-speaking world.
"Entomologists prefer the names ladybird beetles or lady beetles as these insects are not classified as true bugs.The majority of coccinellid species are generally considered beneficial insects, because many species prey on herbivorous hemipterans such as aphids or scale insects, which are agricultural pests."
Many coccinellids lay their eggs directly in aphid and scale insect colonies in order to ensure their larvae have an immediate food source.
"However, some species do have unwelcome effects; among these, the most prominent are of the subfamily Epilachninae (which includes the Mexican bean beetle), which are herbivorous themselves."
"Usually, epilachnines are only minor agricultural pests, eating the leaves of grain, potatoes, beans, and various other crops, but their numbers can increase exponentially in years when their natural enemies, such as parasitoid wasps that attack their eggs, are in fewer numbers."
"In such situations, they can do major crop damage."
They occur in practically all the major crop-producing regions of temperate and tropical countries.
"A cactus (plural cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus) is a member of the plant family Cactaceae, a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1750 known species of the order Caryophyllales."
"The word cactus derives, through Latin, from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny plant whose identity is now not certain."
Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes.
"Although some species live in quite humid environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought."
"Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth."
Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water.
"Almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water."
"Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place."
"Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly modified leaves."
"As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade."
"In the absence of leaves, enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis."
"Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north—except for Rhipsalis baccifera, which also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka."
"Cactus spines are produced from specialized structures called areoles, a kind of highly reduced branch."
Areoles are an identifying feature of cacti.
"As well as spines, areoles give rise to flowers, which are usually tubular and multipetaled."
"Many cacti have  short growing seasons and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface."
"Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long drought periods."
"Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called ""crassulacean acid metabolism"" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis."
"Transpiration, during which carbon dioxide enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night."
"The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as malic acid, retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis."
"Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced."
"Many smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from transpiration."
"The tallest free-standing cactus is Pachycereus pringlei, with a maximum recorded height of 19.2 m (63 ft), and the smallest is Blossfeldia liliputiana, only about 1 cm (0.4 in) in diameter at maturity."
A fully grown saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) is said to be able to absorb as much as 200 U.S. gallons (760 l; 170 imp gal) of water during a rainstorm.
A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family.
"At least superficially, plants of the genera Leuenbergeria, Rhodocactus and Pereskia resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them."
"They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems."
"Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation."
Leuenbergeria is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved.
"In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and epiphytes (plants that grow on trees)."
"Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus Schlumbergera)."
"Cacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit)."
Cochineal is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.
"Many succulent plants in both the Old and New World – such as some Euphorbiaceae (euphorbias) – are also spiny stem succulents and because of this are sometimes incorrectly referred to as ""cactus""."
"A working paper or work paper may be: 

A preliminary scientific or technical paper."
"Often, authors will release working papers to share ideas about a topic or to elicit feedback before submitting to a peer reviewed conference or academic journal."
"Working papers are often the basis for related works, and may in themselves be cited by peer-review papers."
They may be considered as grey literature.
Sometimes the term working paper is used synonymously as technical report.
"Working papers are typically hosted on websites, belonging either to the author or the author's affiliated institution."
"The United Nations uses the term ""working paper"" in approximately this sense for the draft of a resolution."
Documents required for a minor to get a job in certain states within the United States.
"Such papers usually require the employer, parent/guardian, school, and a physician to agree to the terms of work laid out by the employer."
Audit working papers: Documents required on an audit of a company's financial statements.
The working papers are the property of the accounting firm conducting the audit.
These papers are formally referred to as Audit Documentation or sometimes as the audit file.
"The documents serve as proof of audit procedures performed, evidence obtained and the conclusion or opinion the auditor reached (AU 339.05)."
"For more information, see AS 3 and AU 339 or www.aicpa.org."
"A structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized."

Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form.
"Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space."
"Junker (Danish: Junker, German: Junker, Dutch: Jonkheer, English: Yunker, Norwegian: Junker, Swedish: Junker Georgian: იუნკერი (Iunkeri)) is a noble honorific, derived from Middle High German Juncherre, meaning ""young nobleman"" or otherwise ""young lord"" (derivation of jung and Herr)."
"The term is traditionally used throughout the German-speaking, Dutch-speaking and Scandinavian-speaking parts of Europe."
"It also was used in the Russian Empire due to Baltic German influence, up until the Russian Revolution."
"The term is currently still in use by the Georgian Defense Forces, for Student officers of the Military Academy, who are being prepared to serve in the army as senior Officers."
"The First Battle of Bull Run (the name used by Union forces), also known as the Battle of First Manassas (the name used by Confederate forces), was the first major battle of the American Civil War."
"The battle was fought on July 21, 1861, in Prince William County, Virginia, just north of the city of Manassas and about 30 miles west-southwest of Washington, D.C."
"The Union's forces were slow in positioning themselves, allowing Confederate reinforcements time to arrive by rail."
"Each side had about 18,000 poorly trained and poorly led troops in their first battle."
"It was a Confederate victory, followed by a disorganized retreat of the Union forces."
"Just months after the start of the war at Fort Sumter, the  Northern public clamored for a march against the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, which was expected to bring an early end to the Confederacy."
"Yielding to political pressure, Brig."
Gen. Irvin McDowell led his unseasoned Union Army across Bull Run against the equally inexperienced Confederate Army of Brig.
Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard camped near Manassas Junction.
"McDowell's ambitious plan for a surprise flank attack on the Confederate left was poorly executed; nevertheless, the Confederates, who had been planning to attack the Union left flank, found themselves at an initial disadvantage."
Confederate reinforcements under Brig.
"Gen. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed."
"A brigade of Virginians under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the Virginia Military Institute, Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, ""Stonewall""."
"The Confederates launched a strong counterattack, and as the Union troops began withdrawing under fire, many panicked and the retreat turned into a rout."
"McDowell's men frantically ran without order in the direction of Washington, D.C."
Both armies were sobered by the fierce fighting and the many casualties and realized that the war was going to be much longer and bloodier than either had anticipated.
The First Battle of Bull Run highlighted many of the problems and deficiencies that were typical of the first year of the war.
"Units were committed piecemeal, attacks were frontal, infantry failed to protect exposed artillery, tactical intelligence was minimal, and neither commander was able to employ his whole force effectively."
"McDowell, with 35,000 men, could commit only about 18,000, and the combined Confederate forces, with about 32,000 men, also committed 18,000."

"It shares borders with Greece and Bulgaria to the northwest; the Black Sea to the north; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq to the southeast; Syria and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea to the west."
Cyprus is located off the south coast.
Turks form the vast majority of the nation's population and Kurds are the largest minority.
"Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest city and financial centre."
"One of the world's earliest permanently settled regions, present-day Turkey was home to important Neolithic sites like Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited by ancient civilisations including the Hattians, Anatolian peoples, Mycenaean Greeks and others."
"Following the conquests of Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient regions in modern Turkey were culturally Hellenised, which continued during the Byzantine era."
"The Seljuk Turks began migrating in the 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small Turkish principalities."
"Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and conquered the Balkans, and the Turkification of Anatolia increased during the Ottoman period."
"After Mehmed II conquered Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under Selim I."

"With the reforms initiated by the country's first president, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Turkey became a secular, unitary and parliamentary republic."
Turkey played a prominent role in the Korean War and joined NATO in 1952.
The country endured several military coups in the latter half of the 20th century.
"The economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth and political stability."
The parliamentary republic was replaced with a presidential system by referendum in 2017.
"Since then, the new Turkish governmental system under president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his party, the AKP, has often been described as Islamist and authoritarian."
"The latter's rule over the country has also led to numerous currency crises, increasing inflation and economic decline, as well as a rise in poverty.Turkey is a regional power and a newly industrialized country, with a geopolitically strategic location."
"Its economy, which is classified among the emerging and growth-leading economies, is the twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the eleventh-largest by PPP."

"The music is based on a four-note ostinato and is in 34 time signature, with the B-flat bell pealing in 68 time."
"The carol is metrically bistable, and a listener can focus on either measure or switch between them."
"It has been adapted for many genres, including: classical, metal, jazz, country music, rock, trap, and pop."
"The piece also features in films, television shows, and parodies."
The Messier objects are a set of 110 astronomical objects catalogued by the French astronomer Charles Messier in his Catalogue des Nébuleuses et des Amas d'Étoiles (Catalogue of Nebulae and Star Clusters).
"Because Messier was only interested in finding comets, he created a list of those non-comet objects that frustrated his hunt for them."
"The compilation of this list, in collaboration with his assistant Pierre Méchain, is known as the Messier catalogue."
"This catalogue of objects is one of the most famous lists of astronomical objects, and many Messier objects are still referenced by their Messier number."
The catalogue includes most of the astronomical deep-sky objects that can easily be observed from Earth's Northern Hemisphere; many Messier objects are popular targets for amateur astronomers.A preliminary version first appeared in 1774 in the Memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences for the year 1771.
The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects which were not yet numbered.
"Eighteen of the objects were discovered by Messier, the rest being previously observed by other astronomers."
By 1780 the catalogue had increased to 70 objects.
The final version of the catalogue containing 103 objects was published in 1781 in the Connaissance des Temps for the year 1784.
"However, due to what was thought for a long time to be the incorrect addition of Messier 102, the total number remained 102."
"Other astronomers, using side notes in Messier's texts, eventually filled out the list up to 110 objects.The catalogue consists of a diverse range of astronomical objects, from star clusters and nebulae to galaxies."
"For example, Messier 1 is a supernova remnant, known as the Crab Nebula, and the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy is M 31."
"Further inclusions followed, the first addition came from Nicolas Camille Flammarion in 1921, who added Messier 104 after finding Messier's side note in his 1781 edition exemplar of the catalogue."
"M 105 to M 107 were added by Helen Sawyer Hogg in 1947, M 108 and M 109 by Owen Gingerich in 1960, and M 110 by Kenneth Glyn Jones in 1967."
"A circus is a company of performers who put on diverse entertainment shows that may include clowns, acrobats, trained animals, trapeze acts, musicians, dancers, hoopers, tightrope walkers, jugglers, magicians, ventriloquists, and unicyclists as well as other object manipulation and stunt-oriented artists."
The term circus also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history.
"Although not the inventor of the medium, Philip Astley is credited as the father of the modern circus."
"In 1768, Astley, a skilled equestrian, began performing exhibitions of trick horse riding in an open field called Ha'Penny Hatch on the south side of the Thames River."
"In 1770, he hired acrobats, tightrope walkers, jugglers and a clown to fill in the pauses between the equestrian demonstrations and thus chanced on the format which was later named a ""circus""."
"Performances developed significantly over the next fifty years, with large-scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature."
"The traditional format, in which a ringmaster introduces a variety of choreographed acts set to music, developed in the latter part of the 19th century and remained the dominant format until the 1970s."
"As styles of performance have developed since the time of Astley, so too have the types of venues where these circuses have performed."
The earliest modern circuses were performed in open-air structures with limited covered seating.
"From the late 18th to late 19th century, custom-made circus buildings (often wooden) were built with various types of seating, a centre ring, and sometimes a stage."
"The traditional large tents commonly known as ""big tops"" were introduced in the mid-19th century as touring circuses superseded static venues."
These tents eventually became the most common venue.
"Contemporary circuses perform in a variety of venues including tents, theatres and casinos."
"Many circus performances are still held in a ring, usually 13 m (42 ft) in diameter."
This dimension was adopted by Astley in the late 18th century as the minimum diameter that enabled an acrobatic horse rider to stand upright on a cantering horse to perform their tricks.
"Contemporary circus has been credited with a revival of the circus tradition since the late 1970s, when a number of groups began to experiment with new circus formats and aesthetics, typically avoiding the use of animals to focus exclusively on human artistry."
"Circuses within the movement have tended to favour a theatrical approach, combining character-driven circus acts with original music in a broad variety of styles to convey complex themes or stories."
"Contemporary circus continues to develop new variations on the circus tradition while absorbing new skills, techniques, and stylistic influences from other performing arts."
"The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems."
"As a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours."
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
"Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol."
"The unit of measurement ""day"" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds."
The second is designated the SI base unit of time.
"Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition."
"A civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time."
"Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis."
"However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next."
"For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word ""daytime"" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear."
"The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, ""On which day?"""
The biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface.
"Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth."
"The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect)."
"Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations."
"In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can prevail."
"Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction, the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect."
Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy.
"The wind is also a critical means of transportation for seeds, insects, and birds, which can travel on wind currents for thousands of miles."
"In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing."
Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts.
Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls.
"Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, gale, storm, and hurricane."
"In outer space, solar wind is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through space, while planetary wind is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into space."
The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn.
"In human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in mythology, influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a power source for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation."
Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans.
"Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption."
Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft.
"When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed."
"Winds can shape landforms, via a variety of aeolian processes such as the formation of fertile soils, for example loess, and by erosion."
Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the prevailing winds; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions.
Wind also affects the spread of wildfires.
"Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations."
"When combined with cold temperatures, the wind has a negative impact on livestock."
"Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies."
"A bay is a recessed, coastal body of water that directly connects to a larger main body of water, such as an ocean, a lake, or even another bay."
"A large bay is usually called a gulf, sea, sound, or bight."
"A cove is a small, circular bay with a narrow entrance."
A fjord is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity.
"A bay can be the estuary of a river, such as the Chesapeake Bay, an estuary of the Susquehanna River."
"Bays may also be nested within each other; for example, James Bay is an arm of Hudson Bay in northeastern Canada."
"Some large bays, such as the Bay of Bengal and Hudson Bay, have varied marine geology."
The land surrounding a bay often reduces the strength of winds and blocks waves.
Bays may have as wide a variety of shoreline characteristics as other shorelines.
"In some cases, bays have beaches, which ""are usually characterized by a steep upper foreshore with a broad, flat fronting terrace""."
Bays were significant in the history of human settlement because they provided safe places for fishing.
Later they were important in the development of sea trade as the safe anchorage they provide encouraged their selection as ports.
"Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or hachis Parmentier  is a dish consisting of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato."
"Its defining ingredients are red meat and onions in gravy or sauce, with a topping of mashed potato."
Common variants include adding vegetables to the filling and topping the dish with cheese.
The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.
It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.
"In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails."
"A railroad worm is a larva or larviform female adult of a beetle of the genus Phrixothrix in the family Phengodidae, characterized by the possession of two different colors of bioluminescence."
It has the appearance of a caterpillar.
"The eleven pairs of luminescent organs on their second thoracic segment through their ninth abdominal segment can glow yellowish-green, while the pair on their head can glow red; this is due to different luciferases in their bodies, as the reaction substrate, called luciferin, is the same.The ""railroad worm"" name arises because these glowing spots along the body resemble the windows of train cars internally illuminated in the night."
"The light emissions are believed to be a warning signal to nocturnal predators of their unpalatability.The term ""railroad worm"" is also sometimes applied to the apple maggot."
"Drywall (also known as plasterboard, wallboard, sheet rock, gypsum board, buster board, custard board, or gypsum panel) is a panel made of calcium sulfate dihydrate (gypsum), with or without additives, typically extruded between thick sheets of facer and backer paper, used in the construction of interior walls and ceilings."
"The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper, glass wool, or a combination of these materials), plasticizer, foaming agent, and various additives that can reduce mildew, flammability, and water absorption."
"In the mid-20th century, drywall construction became prevalent in North America as a time- and labor-saving alternative to traditional lath and plaster."
"Langaha madagascariensis (formerly Langaha nasuta, commonly known as the Madagascar or Malagasy leaf-nosed snake) is a medium-sized highly cryptic arboreal species."
"It is endemic to Madagascar and found in deciduous dry forests and rain forests, often in vegetation 1.5 to 2 meters above the ground."
Celery (Apium graveolens) is a marshland plant in the family Apiaceae that has been cultivated as a vegetable since antiquity.
Celery has a long fibrous stalk tapering into leaves.
"Depending on location and cultivar, either its stalks, leaves or hypocotyl are eaten and used in cooking."
Celery seed powder is used as a spice.
"A balcony (from Italian: balcone, ""scaffold"") is a platform projecting from the wall of a building, supported by columns or console brackets, and enclosed with a balustrade, usually above the ground floor."
Carnival is a Western Christian festive season that occurs before the liturgical season of Lent.
"The main events typically occur during February or early March, during the period historically known as Shrovetide (or Pre-Lent)."
"Carnival typically involves public celebrations, including events such as parades, public street parties and other entertainments, combining some elements of a circus."
Elaborate costumes and masks allow people to set aside their everyday individuality and experience a heightened sense of social unity.
"Participants often indulge in excessive consumption of alcohol, meat, and other foods that will be forgone during upcoming Lent."
"Traditionally, butter, milk, and other animal products were not consumed ""excessively"", rather, their stock was fully consumed as to reduce waste."
"This festival is known for being a time of great indulgence before Lent (which is a time stressing the opposite), with drinking, overeating, and various other activities of indulgence being performed."
"For example, Pancakes, donuts, and other desserts were prepared and eaten for a final time."
"During Lent, animal products are eaten less, and individuals have the ability to make a Lenten sacrifice, thus giving up a certain object or activity of desire."
"Other common features of Carnival include mock battles such as food fights; expressions of social satire; mockery of authorities; costumes of the grotesque body that display exaggerated features such as large noses, bellies, mouths, phalli, or elements of animal bodies; abusive language and degrading acts; depictions of disease and gleeful death; and a general reversal of everyday rules and norms."
"The Italian tradition of wearing masks dates back to the Venice Carnival in the 15th century, and has been an inspiration in Greek theater and Commedia dell'arte for centuries.The term Carnival is traditionally used in areas with a large Catholic presence, as well as in Greece."
"In historically Evangelical Lutheran countries, the celebration is known as Fastelavn, and in areas with a high concentration of Anglicans (Church of England/US Episcopal Church), Methodists, and other Protestants, pre-Lenten celebrations, along with penitential observances, occur on Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras."
"In Slavic Eastern Orthodox nations, Maslenitsa is celebrated during the last week before Great Lent."
"In German-speaking Europe and the Netherlands, the Carnival season traditionally opens on 11/11 (often at 11:11 a.m.)."
This dates back to celebrations before the Advent season or with harvest celebrations of St. Martin's Day.
"Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker."
Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.
"Bruges ( BROOZH, Dutch: Brugge [ˈbrʏɣə] (listen)) is the capital and largest city of the province of West Flanders in the Flemish Region of Belgium, in the northwest of the country, and the seventh-largest city of the country by population."
"The area of the whole city amounts to more than 13,840 hectares (138.4 km2; 53.44 sq miles), including 1,075 hectares off the coast, at Zeebrugge (from Brugge aan zee, meaning 'Bruges by the Sea')."
The historic city centre is a prominent World Heritage Site of UNESCO.
It is oval in shape and about 430 hectares in size.
"The city's total population is 117,073 (1 January 2008), of whom around 20,000 live in the city centre."
"The metropolitan area, including the outer commuter zone, covers an area of 616 km2 (238 sq mi) and has a total of 255,844 inhabitants as of 1 January 2008.Along with a few other canal-based northern cities, such as Amsterdam and St Petersburg, it is sometimes referred to as the Venice of the North."
"Bruges has a significant economic importance, thanks to its port, and was once one of the world's chief commercial cities."
"Bruges is a popular tourism destination within Belgium, and is well known as the seat of the College of Europe, a university institute for European studies."
Cream is a dairy product composed of the higher-fat layer skimmed from the top of milk before homogenization.
"In un-homogenized milk, the fat, which is less dense, eventually rises to the top."
"In the industrial production of cream, this process is accelerated by using centrifuges called ""separators""."
"In many countries, it is sold in several grades depending on the total butterfat content."
"It can be dried to a powder for shipment to distant markets, and contains high levels of saturated fat.Cream skimmed from milk may be called ""sweet cream"" to distinguish it from cream skimmed from whey, a by-product of cheese-making."
"Whey cream has a lower fat content and tastes more salty, tangy and ""cheesy""."
"In many countries, cream is usually sold partially fermented: sour cream, crème fraîche, and so on."
"Both forms have many culinary uses in sweet, bitter, salty and tangy dishes."
"Cream produced by cattle (particularly Jersey cattle) grazing on natural pasture often contains some natural carotenoid pigments derived from the plants they eat; this gives it a slightly yellow tone, hence the name of the yellowish-white color: cream."
This is also the origin of butter's yellow color.
"Cream from goat's milk, water buffalo milk, or from cows fed indoors on grain or grain-based pellets, is white."
"A patrol is commonly a group of personnel, such as law enforcement officers, military personnel, or private security contractors that are assigned to monitor a specific geographic area."
This is also often referred to as a beat.
"British Columbia (commonly abbreviated as BC; French: Colombie-Britannique) is the westernmost province of Canada, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the continental divide of the Rocky Mountains."
"With an estimated population of 5.2 million as of 2021, it is Canada's third-most populous province."
"The capital of British Columbia is Victoria, the fifteenth-largest metropolitan region in Canada, named for Queen Victoria, who reigned over the British Empire at the time of Confederation."
"The largest city is Vancouver, the third-largest metropolitan area in Canada, the largest in Western Canada, and the second-largest in the Pacific Northwest."
"In October 2013, Greater Vancouver had an estimated population of approximately 2.5 million."
"Since 2017, the province has been governed by the New Democratic Party, led by John Horgan, first with a minority government elected in 2017 and subsequently with a majority government elected in 2020."
"The first British settlement in the area was Fort Victoria, established in 1843, which gave rise to the City of Victoria, at first the capital of the separate Colony of Vancouver Island."
"The Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866) was subsequently founded on the mainland by Richard Clement Moody and the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, in response to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush."
"Moody was chief commissioner of Lands and Works for the Colony and the first lieutenant governor of British Columbia: he was hand-picked by the Colonial Office in London to transform British Columbia into the British Empire's ""bulwark in the farthest west"", and ""to found a second England on the shores of the Pacific""."
"Moody selected the site for and founded the original capital of British Columbia, New Westminster, and also established the Cariboo Road and Stanley Park, and also designed the first version of the coat of arms of British Columbia."
"Port Moody is named after him.In 1866, Vancouver Island became part of the colony of British Columbia, and Victoria became the united colony's capital."
"In 1871, British Columbia became the sixth province of Canada."
"Its Latin motto is Splendor sine occasu (""Splendour without Diminishment"")."
British Columbia evolved from British possessions that were established in what is now British Columbia by 1871.
"First Nations, the original inhabitants of the land, have a history of at least 10,000 years in the area."
"Today there are few treaties, and the question of aboriginal title, long ignored, has become a frequently debated legal and political question as a result of recent court actions."
"Notably, the Tsilhqot'in Nation has established aboriginal title to a portion of their territory, as a result of the 2014 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Tsilhqot'in Nation v British Columbia."
"British Columbia's economy is primarily based on forestry, mining, cinematography and tourism."
British Columbia also benefits from high property values and being a centre for maritime trade.
"Although less than 5 percent of its territory is arable land, a lot of agriculture is done in the Fraser Valley and Okanagan thanks to the warmer climate."
It is the fourth-largest province or territory by GDP.
"Sky burial (Tibetan: བྱ་གཏོར་, Wylie: bya gtor, lit."
"""bird-scattered"") is a funeral practice in which a human corpse is placed on a mountaintop to decompose while exposed to the elements or to be eaten by scavenging animals, especially carrion birds."
It is a specific type of the general practice of excarnation.
"It is practiced in the Chinese provinces and autonomous regions of Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia, as well as in Mongolia, Bhutan and parts of India such as Sikkim and Zanskar."
The locations of preparation and sky burial are understood in the Vajrayana Buddhist traditions as charnel grounds.
Comparable practices are part of Zoroastrian burial practices where deceased are exposed to the elements and birds of prey on stone structures called Dakhma.
"Few such places remain operational today due to religious marginalisation, urbanisation and the decimation of vulture populations.The majority of Tibetan people and many Mongols adhere to Vajrayana Buddhism, which teaches the transmigration of spirits."
"There is no need to preserve the body, as it is now an empty vessel."
Birds may eat it or nature may cause it to decompose.
The function of the sky burial is simply to dispose of the remains in as generous a way as possible (the origin of the practice's Tibetan name).
"In much of Tibet and Qinghai, the ground is too hard and rocky to dig a grave, and due to the scarcity of fuel and timber, sky burials were typically more practical than the traditional Buddhist practice of cremation."
"In the past, cremation was limited to high lamas and some other dignitaries, but modern technology and difficulties with sky burial have led to an increased use of cremation by commoners.Other nations which performed air burial were the Caucasus nations of Georgians, Abkhazians and Adyghe people, in which they put the corpse in a hollow tree trunk."
"Toast of… is a British television sitcom, known either as Toast of London (when it was set in London) or Toast of Tinseltown (with episodes set in America)."
"It was created by Arthur Mathews and Matt Berry and stars Berry as Steven Toast, an eccentric, middle-aged actor with a chequered past who spends more time dealing with his problems off stage than performing on it."
Prior (or  prioress) is an ecclesiastical title for a  superior in some religious orders.
"The word is derived from the Latin for ""earlier"" or ""first""."
Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior.
"In abbeys, a prior would be lower in rank than the abbey's abbot or abbess."
The foot (plural: feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates.
It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion.
"In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails."
Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food.
"The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds."
"An alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural tradition."
"It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses."
"Originally, vegetables were collected from the wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new agricultural way of life developed."
"At first, plants which grew locally would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types."
"Nowadays, most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations."
"China is the largest producer of vegetables, and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries."
"The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food, to agribusinesses with vast acreages of single-product crops."
"Depending on the type of vegetable concerned, harvesting the crop is followed by grading, storing, processing, and marketing."
"Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber."
"Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables, five or more portions a day often being recommended."
Whole blood (WB) is human blood from a standard blood donation.
"It is used in the treatment of massive bleeding, in exchange transfusion, and when people donate blood to themselves."
One unit of whole blood (~517 mls) brings up hemoglobin levels by about 10 g/L.
Cross matching is typically done before the blood is given.
"It is given by injection into a vein.Side effects include red blood cell breakdown, high blood potassium, infection, volume overload, lung injury, and allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis."
"Whole blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and blood plasma."
"It is best within a day of collection; however, can be used for up to three weeks."
"The blood is typically combined with an anticoagulant and preservative during the collection process.The first transfusion of whole blood was in 1818; however, common use did not begin until the First and Second World Wars."
"It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system."
In the 1980s the cost of whole blood was about US$50 per unit in the United States.
Whole blood is not commonly used outside of the developing world and military.
"It is used to make a number of blood products including packed red blood cells, platelet concentrate, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma."
"A whistle is an instrument which produces sound from a stream of gas, most commonly air."
"It may be mouth-operated, or powered by air pressure, steam, or other means."
Whistles vary in size from a small slide whistle or nose flute type to a large multi-piped church organ.
Whistles have been since early humans first carved out a gourd or branch and found they could make sound with it.
"In prehistoric Egypt, small shells were used as whistles."
Many present day wind instruments are inheritors of these early whistles.
"With the rise of more mechanical power, other forms of whistles have been developed."
"One characteristic of a whistle is that it creates a pure, or nearly pure, tone."
The conversion of flow energy to sound comes from an interaction between a solid material and a fluid stream.
The forces in some whistles are sufficient to set the solid material in motion.
"Classic examples are Aeolian tones that result in galloping power lines, or the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (the so-called ""Galloping Gertie"" of popular media)."
"Other examples are circular disks set into vibration.Depending on the geometry, there are two basic types of whistles: those that generate sound through oscillations of fluid mass flow, and those that generate sound through oscillations of the force applied to the surrounding medium."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Engineers, as practitioners of engineering, are professionals who invent, design, analyze, build and test machines, complex systems, structures, gadgets and materials to fulfill functional objectives and requirements while considering the limitations imposed by practicality, regulation, safety and cost."
"The word engineer (Latin ingeniator) is derived from the Latin words ingeniare (""to create, generate, contrive, devise"") and ingenium (""cleverness"")."
"The foundational qualifications of an engineer typically include a four-year bachelor's degree in an engineering discipline, or in some jurisdictions, a master's degree in an engineering discipline plus four to six years of peer-reviewed professional practice (culminating in a project report or thesis) and passage of engineering board examinations."
The work of engineers forms the link between scientific discoveries and their subsequent applications to human and business needs and quality of life.
"Wormian bones, also known as intrasutural bones or sutural bones, are extra bone pieces that can occur within a suture (joint) in the skull."
"These are irregular isolated bones that can appear in addition to the usual centres of ossification of the skull and, although unusual, are not rare."
"They occur most frequently in the course of the lambdoid suture, which is more tortuous than other sutures."
They are also occasionally seen within the sagittal and coronal sutures.
"A large wormian bone at lambda is often called an Inca bone (Os Incae), due to the relatively high frequency of occurrence in Peruvian mummies."
"Another specific Wormian bone, the pterion ossicle, sometimes exists between the sphenoidal angle of the parietal bone and the great wing of the sphenoid bone."
They tend to vary in size and can be found on either side of the skull.
"Usually, not more than several are found in a single individual, but more than one hundred have been once found in the skull of a hydrocephalic adult."
"Wormian bones are a marker for some diseases and important in the primary diagnosis of brittle bone disease: osteogenesis imperfecta.Wormian bones may also be seen in: 

Pycnodysostosis
Osteogenesis imperfecta
Rickets
""Kinky-hair"" Menke's syndrome
Cleidocranial dysostosis
Hypothyroidism and hypophosphatasia
Otopalatodigital syndrome
Primary acro-osteolysis
Down syndrome"
Police Squad!
was an American television crime comedy series broadcast on the ABC network in 1982.
"It was created by David Zucker, Jim Abrahams, and Jerry Zucker, and starred Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin."
"A spoof of police procedurals, the series featured Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker's usual sight gags, wordplay and non sequiturs."
"While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the Lee Marvin cop show M Squad (in particular the opening credits) and the late 1960s series Felony Squad."
"Although the show was canceled after six episodes, it was later followed by a successful film trilogy, The Naked Gun, which was produced from 1988 to 1994."
"In 2013, TV Guide ranked it #7 on its list of 60 shows that were ""Cancelled Too Soon""."
"Gorillas are herbivorous,  predominantly ground-dwelling great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa."
"The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies."
"The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos."
"Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex."
"They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback."
The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences.
Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.
Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa.
"Although their range covers a small percentage of Sub-Saharan Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations."
"The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft)."
"Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda."
"There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas."
"Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered."
"There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species."
"However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live."
"A prince is a male ruler (ranked below a king, grand prince, and grand duke) or a male member of a monarch's or former monarch's family."
"Prince is also a title of nobility (often highest), often hereditary, in some European states."
The feminine equivalent is a princess.
"The English word derives, via the French word prince, from the Latin noun prīnceps, from primus (first) and capio (to seize), meaning ""the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble ruler, prince""."
"Captain is a title for the commander of a military unit, the commander of a ship, aeroplane, spacecraft, or other vessel, or the commander of a port, fire department or police department, election precinct, etc."
"The captain is a military rank in armies, navies, Public Health Service, coast guards, etc., typically at the level of an officer commanding a company or battalion of infantry, a ship, or a battery of artillery, or similar distinct unit."
The terms also may be used as an informal or honorary title for persons in similar commanding roles.
"Law is a system of rules created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior, with its precise definition a matter of longstanding debate."
It has been variously described as a science and the art of justice.
"State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions."
"Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation."
"The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein."
"The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people."
"Legal systems vary between countries, with their differences analysed in comparative law."
"In civil law jurisdictions, a legislature or other central body codifies and consolidates the law."
"In common law systems, judges make binding case law through precedent, although on occasion this may be overturned by a higher court or the legislature."
"Historically, religious law influenced secular matters, and is still used in some religious communities."
"Sharia law based on Islamic principles is used as the primary legal system in several countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia.Law's scope can be divided into two domains."
"Public law concerns government and society, including constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law."
"Private law deals with legal disputes between individuals and/or organisations in areas such as contracts, property, torts/delicts and commercial law."
"This distinction is stronger in civil law countries, particularly those with a separate system of administrative courts; by contrast, the public-private law divide is less pronounced in common law jurisdictions.Law provides a source of scholarly inquiry into legal history, philosophy, economic analysis and sociology."
"Law also raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice."
"A sundress or summer dress is an informal or casual dress intended to be worn in warm weather, typically in a lightweight fabric, most commonly cotton, and usually loose-fitting."
"It is commonly a bodice style sleeveless dress, typically with a wide neckline and thin shoulder straps, and may be backless."
"A sundress is typically worn without a layering top and is not usually worn over a blouse, sweater, or t-shirt, or with leggings."
"While the word ""sundress"" was first used in the early 1940s, they really came into vogue in the 1950s, and were especially popularized by Lilly Pulitzer in the 1960s."
Naturism is a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social nudity in private and in public; the word also refers to the cultural movement which advocates and defends that lifestyle.
Both may alternatively be called nudism.
"Though the two terms are broadly interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated."
"That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology."
"Ethical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing."
"At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose."
"Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities."
"Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals through officially designated nude beaches and parks and on to public spaces and buildings in some jurisdictions."
"Legal instrument is a legal term of art that is used for any formally executed written document that can be formally attributed to its author, records and formally expresses a legally enforceable act, process, or contractual duty, obligation, or right, and therefore evidences that act, process, or agreement."
"Examples include a certificate, deed, bond, contract, will, legislative act, notarial act, court writ or process, or any law passed by a competent legislative body in municipal (domestic) or international law."
Many legal instruments were written under seal by affixing a wax or paper seal to the document in evidence of its legal execution and authenticity (which often removed the need for consideration in contract law).
"However, today many jurisdictions have done away with the requirement of documents being under seal in order to give them legal effect."
The brown long-eared bat or common long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) is a small Eurasian insectivorous bat.
"It has distinctive ears, long and with a distinctive fold."
It is extremely similar to the much rarer grey long-eared bat which was only validated as a distinct species in the 1960s.
"An adult brown long-eared bat has a body length of 4.5–4.8 cm, a tail of 4.1–4.6 cm, and a forearm length of 4–4.2 cm."
"The ears are 3.3–3.9 cm in length, and readily distinguish the long-eared bats from most other bat species."
They are relatively slow flyers compared to other bat species.
"Copy testing is a specialized field of marketing research that determines an advertisement's effectiveness based on consumer responses, feedback, and behavior."
"Also known as pre-testing, it might address all media channels including television, print, radio, outdoor signage, internet, and social media."
Automated Copy Testing is a specialized type of digital marketing specifically related to digital advertising.
This involves using software to deploy copy variations of digital advertisements to a live environment and collecting data from real users.
These automated copy tests will generally use a Z-test to determine the statistical significance of results.
"If a specific ad variation out performs the baseline in the copy test, to a desired level of statistical significance, this new copy variation should be used by the marketer."
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time.
The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future.
"The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection."
"In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language."
"The first known use of the word ""past"" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning ""to pass."""
"A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic energy."
"Pumps can be classified into three major groups according to the method they use to move the fluid: direct lift, displacement, and gravity pumps.Pumps operate by some mechanism (typically reciprocating or rotary), and consume energy to perform mechanical work moving the fluid."
"Pumps operate via many energy sources, including manual operation, electricity, engines, or wind power, and come in many sizes, from microscopic for use in medical applications, to large industrial pumps."
"Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for  water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems."
"In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis."
"When a casing contains only one revolving impeller, it is called a single-stage pump."
"When a casing contains two or more revolving impellers, it is called a double- or multi-stage pump."
"In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps."
"The northern snakehead (Channa argus) is a species of snakehead fish native to China, Russia, North Korea, and South Korea, ranging from the Amur River to Hainan."
"It has been introduced to other regions, where it is considered invasive."
"In Europe, the first report of the species was from Czechoslovakia in 1956."
"In the United States, the fish is considered to be a highly invasive species."
Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten.
"Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season."
"Freezing food slows decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species."
"In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing)."
The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture.
Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure.
Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available due to the ultra low liquid nitrogen temperature −196 °C (−320 °F).Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers.
Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase.
"An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK's Waste & Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food ""as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date""."
"The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change, provided the food had been stored correctly up to that time."
"A gun is a ranged weapon designed to use a shooting tube (gun barrel) to launch typically solid projectiles, but can also project pressurized liquid (e.g."
"water guns/cannons, spray guns for painting or pressure washing, projected water disruptors, and technically also flamethrowers), gas (e.g."
light-gas gun) or even charged particles (e.g.
plasma gun).
"Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Taser guns, spearguns and harpoon guns)."
A large-caliber gun is also referred to as a cannon.
"The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within the barrel tube, produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns)."
"The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle."
"Alternatively, new-concept linear motor weapons may employ an electromagnetic field to achieve acceleration, in which case the barrel may be substituted by guide rails (as in railguns) or wrapped with magnetic coils (as in coilguns)."
The first devices identified as guns or proto-guns appeared in China from around CE 1000.
"By the end of the 13th century, they had become ""true guns,"" metal barrel firearms that fired single projectiles which occluded the barrel."
Gunpowder and gun technology spread throughout Eurasia during the 14th century.
"The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant."
The species originated in western South America and Central America.
"The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived."
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
"The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange."
"From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor."
"The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks."
"While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year."
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
"Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals."
"(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.)"
"The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width."
A fern (Polypodiopsida or  Polypodiophyta ) is a member of a group of vascular plants (plants with xylem and phloem) that reproduce via spores and have neither seeds nor flowers.
"They differ from mosses and other bryophytes by being vascular, i.e., having specialized tissues that conduct water and nutrients and in having life cycles in which the branched sporophyte is the dominant phase."
"Ferns have complex leaves called megaphylls, that are more complex than the microphylls of clubmosses."
Most ferns are leptosporangiate ferns.
They produce coiled fiddleheads that uncoil and expand into fronds.
"The group includes about 10,560 known extant species."
"Ferns are defined here in the broad sense, being all of the Polypodiopsida, comprising both the leptosporangiate (Polypodiidae) and eusporangiate ferns, the latter group including horsetails, whisk ferns, marattioid ferns, and ophioglossoid ferns."
"Ferns first appear in the fossil record about 360 million years ago in the late Devonian period, but many of the current families and species did not appear until roughly 145 million years ago in the early Cretaceous, after flowering plants came to dominate many environments."
"The fern Osmunda claytoniana is a paramount example of evolutionary stasis; paleontological evidence indicates it has remained unchanged, even at the level of fossilized nuclei and chromosomes, for at least 180 million years."
"Ferns are not of major economic importance, but some are used for food, medicine, as biofertilizer, as ornamental plants and for remediating contaminated soil."
They have been the subject of research for their ability to remove some chemical pollutants from the atmosphere.
"Some fern species, such as bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and water fern (Azolla filiculoides) are significant weeds worldwide."
"Some fern genera, such as Azolla, can fix nitrogen and make a significant input to the nitrogen nutrition of rice paddies."
They also play certain roles in folklore.
"During the Cold War, a number of pilots from various nations (Eastern Bloc, Western Bloc, and non-aligned) defected with their aircraft to other countries."
Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services).
"Simply put, it is ""any activity or enterprise entered into for profit."
"""Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business."
"If the business acquires debts, the creditors can go after the owner's personal possessions."
A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates.
The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.
The term is also often used colloquially (but not by lawyers or by public officials) to refer to a company.
"A company, on the other hand, is a separate legal entity and provides for limited liability, as well as corporate tax rates."
"A company structure is more complicated and expensive to set up, but offers more protection and benefits for the owner."
A sentry box is a small shelter with an open front in which a sentry or person on guard duty may stand to be sheltered from the weather.
Many boxes are decorated in national colours.
"A prison, also known as a jail or gaol (dated, standard English, Australian, and historically in Canada), penitentiary (American English and Canadian English), detention center (or detention centre outside the US), correction center, correctional facility,  lock-up or remand center, is a facility in which inmates (or prisoners) are confined and denied a variety of freedoms under the authority of the state as punishment for various crimes."
Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal justice system: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; those pleading or being found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
"In simplest terms, a prison can also be described as a building in which people are legally held as a punishment for a crime they have committed."
Prisons can also be used as a tool of political repression by authoritarian regimes.
"Their perceived opponents may be imprisoned for political crimes, often without trial or other legal due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice."
"In times of war, prisoners of war or detainees may be detained in military prisons or prisoner of war camps, and large groups of civilians might be imprisoned in internment camps."
"In American English, the terms prison and jail have separate definitions, though this is not always followed in casual speech."
"A prison or penitentiary holds people for longer periods of time, such as many years, and is operated by a state or federal government."
A jail holds people for shorter periods of time (e.g.
"for shorter sentences or pre-trial detention) and is usually operated by a local government, typically the county sheriff."
"Outside of North America, prison and jail often have the same meaning."
"Dinnertime is the second album by Alex Taylor, brother of James, Livingston and Kate Taylor."
The album was recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio.
"The standout tracks are ""Change Your Sexy Ways"", Randy Newman's ""Lets Burn Down the Cornfield"", Scott Boyer's ""Comin' Back to You"", and Stephen Stills' ""Four Days Gone""."
Time-and-a-half is payment to a worker (or workers) at 1.5 times their usual hourly rate.
It is usually paid as an incentive to work on a particular day (such as Saturday) or as government-mandated compensation for having workers work on particular days (such as public holidays).
"Respect, also called esteem, is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something considered important or held in high esteem or regard."
It conveys a sense of admiration for good or valuable qualities.
"It is also the process of honoring someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.Some people may earn the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles."
"In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they prove otherwise."
"Courtesies that show respect may include simple words and phrases like ""Thank you"" in the West or ""Namaste"" in the Indian subcontinent, or simple physical signs like a slight bow, a smile, direct eye contact, or a simple handshake; however, those acts may have very different interpretations, depending on the cultural context."
"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context."
"The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment."
Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
"Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money."
"Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity."
"It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ""all debts, public and private""."
Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
"The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts)."
"Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries."
"In chemistry, a hydrate is a substance that contains water or its constituent elements."
"The chemical state of the water varies widely between different classes of hydrates, some of which were so labeled before their chemical structure was understood."
"In botany, a plant shoot  consists of any plant stem together with its appendages, leaves and lateral buds, flowering stems, and flower buds."
The new growth from seed germination that grows upward is a shoot where leaves will develop.
"In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth that grows from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth that grows on woody plants."
"In everyday speech, shoots are often synonymous with stems."
"Stems, which are an integral component of shoots, provide an axis for buds, fruits, and leaves."
"Young shoots are often eaten by animals because the  fibers in the new growth have not yet completed secondary cell wall development, making the young shoots softer and easier to chew and digest."
"As shoots grow and age, the cells develop secondary cell walls that have a hard and tough structure."
Some plants (e.g.
bracken) produce toxins that make their shoots inedible or less palatable.
"The Concord grape is a cultivar derived from the grape species Vitis labrusca (also known as fox grape) that are used as table grapes, wine grapes and juice grapes."
"They are often used to make grape jelly, grape juice, grape pies, grape-flavored soft drinks, and candy."
"The grape is sometimes used to make wine, particularly sacramental kosher wine."
"Traditionally, most commercially produced Concord wines have been finished sweet, but dry versions are possible if adequate fruit ripeness is achieved."
The grape is named after the town in Massachusetts where it was developed.
"The skin of a Concord grape is typically dark blue or purple, and often is covered with a lighter-coloured epicuticular wax ""bloom"" that can be rubbed off."
"It is a slip-skin variety, meaning that the skin is easily separated from the fruit."
Concord grapes have large seeds and are highly aromatic.
"The Concord grape is particularly prone to the physiological disorder black spot.In the United States 417,800 tons were produced in 2011."
"The major growing areas are the Finger Lakes District of New York, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Southwestern Michigan, and the Yakima Valley in Washington."
They are sometimes found growing wild.
Iron () is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26.
It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.
"It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core."
It is the fourth most common element in the Earth's crust.
"In its metallic state, iron is rare in the Earth's crust, limited mainly to deposition by meteorites."
"Iron ores, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) or higher, about 500 °C (900 °F) higher than that required to smelt copper."
"Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BCE and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys, in some regions, only around 1200 BCE."
That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age.
"In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost."
"The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or per pound (see Metal#uses)."
Pristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray.
"However, iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to give brown to black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust."
"Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion."
"Although iron readily reacts, high purity iron, called electrolytic iron, has better corrosion resistance."
"The body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin."
"These two proteins play essential roles in vertebrate metabolism, respectively oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles."
"To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet."
"Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III)."
"Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium."
"Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, −2 to +7."
"Iron also forms many coordination compounds; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue, have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications."
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
"Self-incrimination is the act of exposing oneself generally, by making a statement, ""to an accusation or charge of crime; to involve oneself or another [person] in a criminal prosecution or the danger thereof""."
"(Self-incrimination can occur either directly or indirectly: directly, by means of interrogation where information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed; or indirectly, when information of a self-incriminatory nature is disclosed voluntarily without pressure from another person).In many legal systems, accused criminals cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves—they may choose to speak to police or other authorities, but they cannot be punished for refusing to do so."
"There are 108 countries and jurisdictions that currently issue legal warnings to suspects, which include the right to remain silent and the right to legal counsel."
"These laws are not uniform across the world; however, members of the European Union have developed their laws around the EU's guide."
A country is a distinct territorial body or political entity.
"It may be an independent sovereign state or part of a larger state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, a physical territory with a government, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated peoples with distinct political characteristics."
It is not inherently sovereign.
"The largest country in the world by geographical area is Russia, while the most populous is China."
The smallest and the least populous is the microstate Vatican City.
"An error (from the Latin error, meaning ""wandering"") is an action which is inaccurate or incorrect."
"In some usages, an error is synonymous with a mistake."
"In statistics, ""error"" refers to the difference between the value which has been computed and the correct value."
An error could result in failure or in a deviation from the intended performance or behavior.
"The Yellowstone River is a tributary of the Missouri River, approximately 692 miles (1,114 km) long, in the Western United States."
"Considered the principal tributary of upper Missouri, via its tributaries, it drains an area stretching from the Rocky Mountains in the vicinity of Yellowstone National Park, across the mountains and high plains of southern Montana and northern Wyoming."
"It flows northeast to its confluence with the Missouri River on the North Dakota side of the border, about 25 miles west of present-day Williston."
"In the sport of ten-pin bowling, there are many different ways in which to deliver (known as a ""throw"" or ""roll"") the bowling ball in order to advance it toward the pins in an accurate and powerful manner."
"Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling."
"The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form."
"The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy."
"In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category."
"A well-known variant of ""tweening"" is the power stroker."
"Power stroking is often very similar to cranking and bowlers can often fit in either category, therefore bowlers that use one of these two styles are often simply known as power players."
"A fourth style, known as helicopter, spinning, or UFO, is a style that is used to great effect in Asia."
"Finally, many modern bowlers have changed to a one- or two-handed no-thumb delivery."
Most of the various forms use different wrist and hand positions and rely on different timings and body positions to accommodate the differences in each style of release.
"A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of nerve fibers (called axons) in the peripheral nervous system."
A nerve transmits electrical impulses.
It is the basic unit of the peripheral nervous system.
"A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses called action potentials that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs or, in the case of sensory nerves, from the periphery back to the central nervous system."
"Each axon, within the nerve, is an extension of an individual neuron, along with other supportive cells such as some Schwann cells that coat the axons in myelin."
"Within a nerve, each axon is surrounded by a layer of connective tissue called the endoneurium."
"The axons are bundled together into groups called fascicles, and each fascicle is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the perineurium."
"Finally, the entire nerve is wrapped in a layer of connective tissue called the epineurium."
"Nerve cells (often called neurons) are further classified as sensory, motor, or mixed nerves."
"In the central nervous system, the analogous structures are known as nerve tracts."
A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation.
"The word ""laser"" is an acronym for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation""."
"The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow ()."
A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light which is coherent.
"Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography."
"Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers and lidar."
"Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum."
"Alternatively, temporal coherence can be used to produce ultrashort pulses of light with a broad spectrum but durations as short as a femtosecond."
"Lasers are used in optical disc drives, laser printers, barcode scanners, DNA sequencing instruments, fiber-optic, semiconducting chip manufacturing (photolithography), and free-space optical communication, laser surgery and skin treatments, cutting and welding materials, military and law enforcement devices for marking targets and measuring range and speed, and in laser lighting displays for entertainment."
Semiconductor lasers in the blue to near-UV have also been used in place of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to excite fluorescence as a white light source.
This permits a much smaller emitting area due to the much greater radiance of a laser and avoids the droop suffered by LEDs; such devices are already used in some car headlamps.
"FireHouse is an American rock band which formed in Richmond, Virginia before moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, where they were signed to Epic Records in 1989."
"The band reached stardom during the early 1990s with hit singles like, ""Reach for the Sky"", ""Don't Treat Me Bad,"" and ""All She Wrote,"" as well as their signature power ballads, ""I Live My Life for You,"" ""Love of a Lifetime,"" and ""When I Look Into Your Eyes."""
"At the 1992 American Music Awards, FireHouse won the award for ""Favorite New Heavy Metal/Hard Rock Artist."
"""As the 1990s progressed, the band remained very popular in Asia, mainly in Southeast Asian countries such as Japan, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore."
They also maintained popularity in South America and Europe.
"FireHouse continued to release new material throughout the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, most of which has successfully charted in Japan."
"The band has also continued to tour internationally, having participated twice in the annual Rock Never Stops Tour with other bands from the same genre."
"FireHouse is estimated to have sold over 7 million albums worldwide since their debut.Originally composed of vocalist/keyboardist C. J. Snare, guitarist Bill Leverty, drummer Michael Foster, and bassist Perry Richardson, the band has maintained its original members with the exception of Richardson, who departed in 2000."
"Richardson was replaced two times before current bassist, Allen McKenzie, was given the position in 2004."
"Captain Fantastic is a 2016 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Matt Ross and starring Viggo Mortensen, Frank Langella, Kathryn Hahn, and Steve Zahn."
The story centers on a family forced by circumstances to reintegrate into society after living in isolation for a decade.
"The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016."
It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.
"It was theatrically released on July 8, 2016 by Bleecker Street."
"It was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten independent films of 2016 and Mortensen was nominated for the Golden Globe, the BAFTA Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actor."
"A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges."
"A judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling in the case based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment."
"A judge is expected to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court."
"The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions."
"In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury."
"In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate."
The presiding judge ensures that all court proceedings are lawful and orderly.
"The somatosensory system is the network of neural structures in the brain and body that produce the perception of touch, as well as temperature, body position (proprioception), and pain."
"It is a subset of the sensory nervous system, which also represents visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory stimuli."
"Somatosensation begins when mechano- and thermosensitive structures in the skin or internal organs sense physical stimuli such as pressure on the skin (see mechanotransduction, nociception)."
"Activation of these structures, or receptors, leads to activation of peripheral sensory neurons that convey signals to the spinal cord as patterns of action potentials."
"Sensory information is then processed locally in the spinal cord to drive reflexes, and is also conveyed to the brain for conscious perception of touch and proprioception."
"Note, somatosensory information from the face and head enters the brain through peripheral sensory neurons in the cranial nerves, such as the trigeminal nerve."
The neural pathways that go to the brain are structured such that information about the location of the physical stimulus is preserved.
"In this way, neighboring neurons in the somatosensory cerebral cortex in the brain represent nearby locations on the skin or in the body, creating a map, also called a homunculus."
"Memory is the faculty of the brain by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed."
It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.
"If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop."
"Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory."
This can be related to the neuron.
The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent.
Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor.
Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor.
The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.
"Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store data through various categorical models or systems.Declarative, or explicit, memory is the conscious storage and recollection of data."
Under declarative memory resides semantic and episodic memory.
"Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning, while episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane."
Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory.
"Non-declarative, or implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information."
"An example of a non-declarative process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming phenomenon."
"Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that not all memory is consciously activated, whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.Memory is not a perfect processor, and is affected by many factors."
"The ways by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved can all be corrupted."
"Pain, for example, has been identified as a physical condition that impairs memory, and has been noted in animal models as well as chronic pain patients."
The amount of attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.
"Also, the storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory storage, such as the hippocampus."
"Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be disrupted because of decay within long-term memory."
"Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory."
"The term kola nut usually refers to the seeds of certain species of plant of the genus Cola, placed formerly in the cocoa family Sterculiaceae and now usually subsumed in the mallow family Malvaceae (as subfamily Sterculioideae)."
These cola species are trees native to the tropical rainforests of Africa.
"Their caffeine-containing seeds are used as flavoring ingredients in beverages applied to various carbonated soft drinks, from which the name cola originates."
Ingestion  is the consumption of a substance by an organism.
"In animals, it normally is accomplished by taking in a substance through the mouth into the gastrointestinal tract, such as through eating or drinking."
In single-celled organisms ingestion takes place by absorbing a substance through the cell membrane.
"Besides nutritional items, substances that may be ingested include medication (where ingestion is termed oral administration), recreational drugs, and substances considered inedible, such as foreign bodies or excrement."
Ingestion is a common route taken by pathogenic organisms and poisons entering the body.
"Ingestion can also refer to a mechanism picking up something and making it enter an internal hollow of that mechanism, e.g."
"""a grille was fitted to prevent the pump from ingesting driftwood""."
"Lazio (UK: , US: ; Italian: [ˈlattsjo]; Latin: Latium, [ˈɫat̪i.ʊ̃ˑ]) is one of the 20 administrative regions of Italy."
"Situated in the central peninsular section of the country, it has 5,864,321 inhabitants – making it the second most populated region of Italy (after Lombardy and just ahead of Campania) – and its GDP of more than €197 billion per year means that it has the nation's second largest regional economy."
"The capital of Lazio is Rome, which is also the capital and largest city of Italy."
"Scallop () is a common name that is primarily applied to any one of numerous species of saltwater clams or marine bivalve mollusks in the taxonomic family Pectinidae, the scallops."
"However, the common name ""scallop"" is also sometimes applied to species in other closely related families within the superfamily Pectinoidea, which also includes the thorny oysters."
"Scallops are a cosmopolitan family of bivalves which are found in all of the world's oceans, although never in fresh water."
"They are one of very few groups of bivalves to be primarily ""free-living"", with many species capable of rapidly swimming short distances and even of migrating some distance across the ocean floor."
"A small minority of scallop species live cemented to rocky substrates as adults, while others attach themselves to stationary or rooted objects such as sea grass at some point in their lives by means of a filament they secrete called a byssal thread."
"The majority of species, however, live recumbent on sandy substrates, and when they sense the presence of a predator such as a starfish, they may attempt to escape by swimming swiftly but erratically through the water using jet propulsion created by repeatedly clapping their shells together."
"Scallops have a well-developed nervous system, and unlike most other bivalves all scallops have a ring of numerous simple eyes situated around the edge of their mantles."
"Many species of scallops are highly prized as a food source, and some are farmed as aquaculture."
"The word ""scallop"" is also applied to the meat of these bivalves, the adductor muscle, that is sold as seafood."
"The brightly coloured, symmetric, fan-shaped shells of scallops with their radiating and often fluted ornamentation are valued by shell collectors, and have been used since ancient times as motifs in art, architecture, and design."
"Owing to their widespread distribution, scallop shells are a common sight on beaches and are often brightly coloured, making them a popular object to collect among beachcombers and vacationers."
"The shells also have a significant place in popular culture, including symbolism."
"A theory is a rational type of abstract thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking."
The process of contemplative and rational thinking is often associated with such processes as observational study or research.
"Theories may be scientific, belong to a non-scientific discipline, or no discipline at all."
"Depending on the context, a theory's assertions might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works."
"The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings."
"In modern science, the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with the scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science."
"Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction (""falsify"") of it."
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word ""theory"" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis)."
"Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions."
"Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values."
": 131  A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models."
To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.
": 46 The word theory or ""in theory"" is sometimes used erroneously by people to explain something which they individually did not experience or test before."
"In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis."
"Instead of using the word ""hypothetically"", it is replaced by a phrase: ""in theory""."
"In some instances the theory's credibility could be contested by calling it ""just a theory"" (implying that the idea has not even been tested)."
"Hence, that word ""theory"" is very often contrasted to ""practice"" (from Greek praxis, πρᾶξις) a Greek term for doing, which is opposed to theory."
"A ""classical example"" of the distinction between ""theoretical"" and ""practical"" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy."
"These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked."
Duck is the common name for numerous species of waterfowl in the family Anatidae.
"Ducks are generally smaller and shorter-necked than swans and geese, which are members of the same family."
"Divided among several subfamilies, they are a form taxon; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species), since swans and geese are not considered ducks."
"Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water."
"Ducks are sometimes confused with several types of unrelated water birds with similar forms, such as loons or divers, grebes, gallinules and coots."
"An army (from Latin arma ""arms, weapons"" via Old French armée, ""armed"" [feminine]), ground force or land force is a fighting force that fights primarily on land."
"In the broadest sense, it is the land-based military branch, service branch or armed service of a nation or county."
It may also include aviation assets by possessing an army aviation component.
"Within a national military force, the word army may also mean a field army."
"In some countries, such as France and China, the term ""army"", especially in its plural form ""armies"", has the broader meaning of armed forces as a whole, while retaining the colloquial sense of land forces."
"To differentiate the colloquial army from the formal concept of military force, the term is qualified, for example in France the land force is called Armée de terre, meaning Land Army, and the air and space force is called Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace, meaning Air and Space Army."
"The naval force, although not using the term ""army"", is also included in the broad sense of the term ""armies"" — thus the French Navy is an integral component of the collective French Armies (French Armed Forces) under the Ministry of the Armies."
"A similar pattern is seen in China, with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) being the overall military, the land force being the PLA Ground Force, and so forth for the PLA Air Force, the PLA Navy, and other branches."
"By convention, irregular military is understood in contrast to regular armies which grew slowly from personal bodyguards or elite militia."
"Regular in this case refers to standardized doctrines, uniforms, organizations, etc."
"Regular military can also refer to full-time status (standing army), versus reserve or part-time personnel."
"Other distinctions may separate statutory forces (established under laws such as the National Defence Act), from de facto ""non-statutory"" forces such as some guerrilla and revolutionary armies."
Armies may also be expeditionary (designed for overseas or international deployment) or fencible (designed for – or restricted to – homeland defence).
"The word joy means the emotion evoked by well-being, success, or good fortune, and is typically associated with feelings of intense, long lasting happiness."
Slade are  a British rock band formed in Wolverhampton in 1966.
"They rose to prominence during the glam rock era in the early 1970s, achieving 17 consecutive top 20 hits and six number ones on the UK Singles Chart."
The British Hit Singles & Albums names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles.
They were the first act to have three singles enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's chart-toppers were penned by Noddy Holder and Jim Lea.
"As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, ""Merry Xmas Everybody"", has sold in excess of one million copies."
"According to the 1999 BBC documentary It's Slade, the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.Following an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity in the UK waned, but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for Ozzy Osbourne at the Reading Rock Festival."
The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career.
"The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II."
"The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day."
They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.
"A number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins, Ramones, Sex Pistols, The Undertones, The Runaways, The Clash, Kiss, Mötley Crüe, Poison, Def Leppard, Twisted Sister, The Replacements, Cheap Trick, Oasis, Quiet Riot (who covered Slade songs for two of their three biggest hits) and Britny Fox."
"The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist Dave Hill's equally arresting dress sense, and the deliberate misspelling of their song titles (such as ""Cum On Feel the Noize"" and ""Mama Weer All Crazee Now"") for which they became well known."
"An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform calculations, ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics."
The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s.
"Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company Busicom."
They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).
"Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers."
They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost.
"By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools."
"Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices."
"In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets."
"For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical calculations."
Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra.
"Graphing calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional Euclidean space."
"As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more."
"In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information."
"By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%."
"A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan and commit to achieve."
People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.
"A goal is roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an end, which is an object, either a physical object or an abstract object, that has intrinsic value."
"A Fistful of Dollars (Italian: Per un pugno di dollari, lit."
"'For a Fistful of Dollars' titled on-screen as Fistful of Dollars) is a 1964 Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood in his first leading role, alongside John Wells, Marianne Koch, W. Lukschy, S. Rupp, Jose Calvo, Antonio Prieto, and Joe Edger."
"The film, an international co-production between Italy, West Germany, and Spain, was filmed on a low budget (reported to be $200,000), and Eastwood was paid $15,000 for his role.Released in Italy in 1964 and then in the United States in 1967, it initiated the popularity of the Spaghetti Western genre."
"It was followed by For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, also starring Eastwood."
"Collectively, the films are known as the ""Dollars Trilogy"", or the ""Man with No Name Trilogy"" after the United Artists publicity campaign referred to Eastwood's character in all three films as the ""Man with No Name""."
"All three films were later released in sequence in the United States in 1967, catapulting Eastwood into stardom."
"The film has been identified as an unofficial remake of the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo (1961), which resulted in a successful lawsuit by Toho, Yojimbo's production company.As few Spaghetti Westerns had yet been released in the United States, many of the European cast and crew took on American-sounding stage names."
"These included Leone himself (""Bob Robertson""), Gian Maria Volonté (""Johnny Wels""), and composer Ennio Morricone (""Dan Savio"")."
"A Fistful of Dollars was shot in Spain, mostly near Hoyo de Manzanares close to Madrid, but also (like its two sequels) in the Tabernas Desert and in the Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park, both in the province of Almería."
"In medicine, a pulse represents the tactile arterial palpation of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat) by trained fingertips."
"The pulse may be palpated in any place that allows an artery to be compressed near the surface of the body, such as at the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery), at the groin (femoral artery), behind the knee (popliteal artery), near the ankle joint (posterior tibial artery), and on foot (dorsalis pedis artery)."
Pulse (or the count of arterial pulse per minute) is equivalent to measuring the heart rate.
"The heart rate can also be measured by listening to the heart beat by auscultation, traditionally using a stethoscope and counting it for a minute."
The radial pulse is commonly measured using three fingers.
"This has a reason: the finger closest to the heart is used to occlude the pulse pressure, the middle finger is used get a crude estimate of the blood pressure, and the finger most distal to the heart (usually the ring finger)  is used to nullify the effect of the ulnar pulse as the two arteries are connected via the palmar arches (superficial and deep)."
The study of the pulse is known as sphygmology.
Police brutality is the excessive and unwarranted use of force by law enforcement.
It is an extreme form of police misconduct or violence and is a civil rights violation.
It also refers to a situation where officers exercise undue or excessive force against a person.
"Police violence includes but is not limited to physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, inaction of police officers, and in some cases, death."
"The wildlife of the Democratic Republic of the Congo includes its flora and fauna, comprising a large biodiversity in rainforests, seasonally flooded forests and grasslands."
Wildlife is threatened by overhunting for bushmeat.
The country is considered one of the 17 megadiverse nations.
"Its rainforests harbour many rare and endemic species, such as the chimpanzee and the bonobo."
"Five of the country's national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites: the Garumba, Kahuzi-Biega, Salonga and Virunga National Parks, and Okapi Wildlife Reserve."
All five sites are listed by UNESCO as World Heritage In Danger.
The civil war and resultant poor economic conditions have endangered much of this biodiversity.
Many park wardens were either killed or could not afford to continue their work.
The drum is a member of the percussion group of musical instruments.
"In the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system, it is a membranophone."
"Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead or drum skin, that is stretched over a shell and struck, either directly with the player's hands, or with a percussion mallet, to produce sound."
"There is usually a resonance head on the underside of the drum, typically tuned to a slightly lower pitch than the top drumhead."
"Other techniques have been used to cause drums to make sound, such as the thumb roll."
"Drums are the world's oldest and most ubiquitous musical instruments, and the basic design has remained virtually unchanged for thousands of years.Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and some drums such as the djembe are almost always played in this way."
"Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one player, such as bongo drums and timpani."
A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern drum kit.
"A father figure is usually an older man, normally one with power, authority, or strength, with whom one can identify on a deeply psychological level and who generates emotions generally felt towards one's father."
"Despite the literal term ""father figure"", the role of a father figure is not limited to the biological parent of a person (especially a child), but may be played by uncles, grandfathers, elder brothers, family friends, or others."
The similar term mother figure refers to an older woman.
"Several studies have suggested that positive father figures and mother figures (whether biological or not) are generally associated with healthy child development, both in boys and in girls."
Play therapy refers to a range of methods of capitalising on children's natural urge to explore and harnessing it to meet and respond to the developmental and later also their mental health needs.
"It is also used for forensic or psychological assessment purposes where the individual is too young or too traumatised to give a verbal account of adverse, abusive or potentially criminal circumstances in their life."
Play therapy is extensively acknowledged by specialists as an effective intervention in complementing children's personal and inter-personal development.
Play and play therapy are generally employed with children aged six months through late adolescence and young adulthood.
They provide a contained way for them to express their experiences and feelings through an imaginative self-expressive process in the context of a trusted relationship with the care giver or therapist.
"As children's and young people's experiences and knowledge are typically communicated through play, it is an essential vehicle for personality and social development."
"In recent years play therapists in the western hemisphere, as a body of health professionals, are usually members or affiliates of professional training institutions and tend to be subject to codes of ethical practice."
"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop."
"A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three."
"After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws."
"The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated."
"Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill."
"On offense, players may use a variety of shots – the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard."
"It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling."
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.
"The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning)."
"Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one."
"Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports."
"The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition."
"Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas."
The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.
"Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup."
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships.
"The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women."
"Fruit preserves are preparations of fruits whose main preserving agent is sugar and sometimes acid, often stored in glass jars and used as a condiment or spread."
"There are many varieties of fruit preserves globally, distinguished by method of preparation, type of fruit used, and place in a meal."
"Sweet fruit preserves such as jams, jellies and marmalades are often eaten at breakfast on bread or as an ingredient of a pastry or dessert, whereas more savory and acidic preserves made from ""vegetable fruits"" such as tomato, squash or zucchini, are eaten alongside savoury foods such as cheese, cold meats, and curries."
Expect is an extension to the Tcl scripting language written by Don Libes.
The program automates interactions with programs that expose a text terminal interface.
"Expect, originally written in 1990 for the Unix platform, has since become available for Microsoft Windows and other systems."
"Veins are blood vessels in humans, and most other animals that carry blood towards the heart."
"Most veins carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues back to the heart; exceptions are the pulmonary and umbilical veins, both of which carry oxygenated blood to the heart."
"In contrast to veins, arteries carry blood away from the heart."
Veins are less muscular than arteries and are often closer to the skin.
There are valves (called pocket valves) in most veins to prevent backflow.
"Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn."
"At or around the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice."
"The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture."
"When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa."
"Liquid oxygen—abbreviated LOx, LOX or Lox in the aerospace, submarine and gas industries—is the liquid form of molecular oxygen."
"It was used as the oxidizer in the first liquid-fueled rocket invented in 1926 by Robert H. Goddard, an application which has continued to the present."
The Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) is a United States Air Force program that determines promotions to the ranks of Staff Sergeant (E-5) through Technical Sergeant (E-6).
"It provides feedback score sheets to enlisted members considered for promotion, which help members to focus on specific professional development needs."
"Selections for promotion to Master Sergeant (E-7), Senior Master Sergeant (E-8), and Chief Master Sergeant (E-9) utilize an integrated weighted and central selection board system."
"In addition to the weighted score, the central selection board evaluates each individual using the whole person concept."
"Board scores are determined by considering performance, leadership, breadth of experience, job responsibility, professional competence, specific achievements, and education."
The board score is added to the weighted score to determine order of merit for promotion.
Sea cucumbers are echinoderms from the class Holothuroidea ().
"They are marine animals with a leathery skin and an elongated body containing a single, branched gonad."
Sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor worldwide.
"The number of holothurian () species worldwide is about 1,717, with the greatest number being in the Asia-Pacific region."
Many of these are gathered for human consumption and some species are cultivated in aquaculture systems.
"The harvested product is variously referred to as trepang, namako, bêche-de-mer, or balate."
"Sea cucumbers serve a useful role in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients, breaking down detritus and other organic matter, after which bacteria can continue the decomposition process.Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin, calcified structures that are usually reduced to isolated microscopic ossicles (or sclerietes) joined by connective tissue."
"In some species these can sometimes be enlarged to flattened plates, forming an armour."
"In pelagic species such as Pelagothuria natatrix (order Elasipodida, family Pelagothuriidae), the skeleton is absent and there is no calcareous ring.Sea cucumbers are named for their resemblance to the fruit of the cucumber plant."
"Well-being, also known as wellness, prudential value or quality of life, refers to what is intrinsically valuable relative to someone."
"So the well-being of a person is what is ultimately good for this person, what is in the self-interest of this person."
Well-being can refer to both positive and negative well-being.
"In its positive sense, it is sometimes contrasted with ill-being as its opposite."
"The term ""subjective well-being"" denotes how people experience and evaluate their lives, usually measured in relation to self-reported well-being obtained through questionnaires."
"Sometimes different types of well-being are distinguished, like mental well-being, physical well-being, economic wellbeing or emotional well-being."
The different forms of well-being are often closely interlinked.
"For example, improved physical well-being (e.g., by reducing or ceasing an addiction) is associated with improved emotional well-being."
"As another example, better economic well-being (e.g., possessing more wealth) tends to be associated with better emotional well-being even in adverse situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Well-being plays a central role in ethics since what we ought to do depends, at least to some degree, on what would make someone's life go better or worse."
"According to welfarism, there are no other values besides well-being.The terms well-being, pleasure and happiness are used in overlapping ways in everyday language but their meanings tend to come apart in technical contexts like philosophy or psychology."
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good and is usually seen as one constituent of well-being.
"But there may be other factors, such as health, virtue, knowledge or the fulfillment of desires."
"Happiness, often seen either as ""the individual’s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience"" or as the state of being satisfied with one's life as a whole, is also commonly taken to be a constituent of well-being."
Theories of well-being try to determine what is essential to all forms of well-being.
Hedonistic theories equate well-being with the balance of pleasure over pain.
"Desire theories hold that well-being consists in desire-satisfaction: the higher the number of satisfied desires, the higher the well-being."
Objective list theories state that a person's well-being depends on a list of factors that may include both subjective and objective elements.
"Well-being is the central subject of positive psychology, whose goal is to discover the factors that contribute to human well-being."
"Martin Seligman, for example, suggests that these factors consist in having positive emotions, being engaged in an activity, having good relationships with other people, finding meaning in one's life and a sense of accomplishment in the pursuit of one's goals.The Oxford English Dictionary traces the term well-being to a 16th-century calque of the Italian concept benessere."
"In finance and economics, interest is payment from a borrower or deposit-taking financial institution to a lender or depositor of an amount above repayment of the principal sum (that is, the amount borrowed), at a particular rate."
It is distinct from a fee which the borrower may pay the lender or some third party.
"It is also distinct from dividend which is paid by a company to its shareholders (owners) from its profit or reserve, but not at a particular rate decided beforehand, rather on a pro rata basis as a share in the reward gained by risk taking entrepreneurs when the revenue earned exceeds the total costs.For example, a customer would usually pay interest to borrow from a bank, so they pay the bank an amount which is more than the amount they borrowed; or a customer may earn interest on their savings, and so they may withdraw more than they originally deposited."
"In the case of savings, the customer is the lender, and the bank plays the role of the borrower."
"Interest differs from profit, in that interest is received by a lender, whereas profit is received by the owner of an asset, investment or enterprise."
"(Interest may be part or the whole of the profit on an investment, but the two concepts are distinct from each other from an accounting perspective.)"
The rate of interest is equal to the interest amount paid or received over a particular period divided by the principal sum borrowed or lent (usually expressed as a percentage).
Compound interest means that interest is earned on prior interest in addition to the principal.
"Due to compounding, the total amount of debt grows exponentially, and its mathematical study led to the discovery of the number e. In practice, interest is most often calculated on a daily, monthly, or yearly basis, and its impact is influenced greatly by its compounding rate."
A hot dog (less commonly spelled hotdog) is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun.
The term hot dog can also refer to the sausage itself.
"The sausage used is a wiener (Vienna sausage) or a frankfurter (Frankfurter Würstchen, also just called frank)."
The names of these sausages also commonly refer to their assembled dish.
Some consider it to be a sandwich.
Hot dog preparation and condiments vary worldwide.
"Typical condiments include mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, relish, and cheese sauce, and common garnishes include onions, sauerkraut, jalapeños, chili, grated cheese, coleslaw, bacon, and olives."
Hot dog variants include the corn dog and pigs in a blanket.
The hot dog's cultural traditions include the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.
These types of sausages were culturally imported from Germany and became popular in the United States.
"It became a working-class street food in the U.S., sold at stands and carts."
The hot dog became closely associated with baseball and American culture.
"Although particularly connected with New York City and its cuisine, the hot dog eventually became ubiquitous throughout the US during the 20th century."
"Its preparation varies regionally in the country, emerging as an important part of other regional cuisines, including Chicago street cuisine."
"Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died) or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate."
"Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria."
Biology is the science that studies life.
There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life.
"One popular definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve."
Other definitions sometimes include non-cellular life forms such as viruses and viroids.
"Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such as simple organic compounds."
"The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a gradual process of increasing complexity."
"Life on Earth first appeared as early as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago, and not long after the formation of Earth 4.54 billion years ago."
The earliest known life forms are bacteria.
"Life on Earth is probably descended from an RNA world, although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed."
Metal-Binding Proteins that allowed biological electron transfer may have evolved from minerals.
"The classic 1952 Miller–Urey experiment and similar research demonstrated that most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions intended to replicate those of the early Earth."
"Complex organic molecules occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and conditions."
"Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on Earth."
The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.
"There are two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids."
"Cells reproduce through a process of cell division, in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells."
"In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by ""life"" through obsolete concepts such as Odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries."
Aristotle is considered to be the first person to classify organisms.
"Later, Carl Linnaeus introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of species."
"Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as cells and microorganisms, forcing significant revisions of the structure of relationships between living organisms."
"Though currently only known on Earth, life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the existence of extraterrestrial life."
"Artificial life is a computer simulation or human-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine systems related to natural life."
"Death is the permanent termination of all biological processes which sustain an organism, and as such, is the end of its life."
"Extinction is the term describing the dying-out of a group or taxon, usually a species."
Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of organisms.
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.
"Another definition is ""any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided""."
"Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest)."
"Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet."
"The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth."
"Acting as a huge  heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle."
Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.
The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean.
The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present.
"The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur."
This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse.
"Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients."
Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere.
This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.
Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark.
"The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less."
Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf.
Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface.
"In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F)."
"Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F)."
Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean.
Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents.
"These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity."
"Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves."
"Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current."
"Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe."
This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.
"Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.
"The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification."
"The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation."
It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to  food and other resources.
"Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species."
"However, the ocean is subject to numerous environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification and other effects of climate change."
The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.
A box (plural: boxes) is a container used for the storage or transportation of its contents.
"Most boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides."
"Boxes can be very small (like a matchbox) or very large (like a shipping box for furniture), and can be used for a variety of purposes from functional to decorative."
"Boxes may be made of a variety of materials, both durable, such as wood and metal; and non-durable, such as corrugated fiberboard and paperboard."
Corrugated metal boxes are commonly used as shipping containers.
"Most commonly, boxes have flat, parallel, rectangular sides, making them rectangular prisms; but boxes may also have other shapes."
"Boxes may be closed and shut with flaps, doors, or a separate lid."
"They can be secured shut with adhesives, tapes, or more decorative or elaborately functional mechanisms, such as a catch, clasp or lock."
"Red is the colour at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet."
It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–740 nanometres.
"It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan."
"Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art."
The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories.
"It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces."
": 60–61  In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal."
"The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes."
"Red became a symbolic color of communism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries."
"Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage."
"Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy."
"In China, India and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune."

The gustatory system or sense of taste is the sensory system that is partially responsible for the perception of taste (flavor).
"Taste is the perception produced or stimulated when a substance in the mouth reacts chemically with taste receptor cells located on taste buds in the oral cavity, mostly on the tongue."
"Taste, along with  olfaction and trigeminal nerve stimulation (registering texture, pain, and temperature), determines flavors of food and other substances."
Humans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis.
The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.
"The tongue is covered with thousands of small bumps called papillae, which are visible to the naked eye."
Within each papilla are hundreds of taste buds.
The exception to this is the filiform papillae that do not contain taste buds.
There are between 2000 and 5000 taste buds that are located on the back and front of the tongue.
"Others are located on the roof, sides and back of the mouth, and in the throat."
Each taste bud contains 50 to 100 taste receptor cells.
"Taste receptors in the mouth sense the five taste modalities: sweetness, sourness, saltiness,  bitterness, and savoriness (also known as savory or umami)."
Scientific experiments have demonstrated that these five tastes exist and are distinct from one another.
Taste buds are able to distinguish between different tastes through detecting interaction with different molecules or ions.
"Sweet, savoriness, and bitter tastes are triggered by the binding of molecules to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membranes of taste buds."
"Saltiness and sourness are perceived when alkali metal or hydrogen ions enter taste buds, respectively.The basic taste modalities contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth—other factors include smell, detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc."
"; temperature, detected by thermoreceptors; and ""coolness"" (such as of menthol) and ""hotness"" (pungency), through chemesthesis."
"As the gustatory system senses both harmful and beneficial things, all basic taste modalities are classified as either aversive or appetitive, depending upon the effect the things they sense have on our bodies."
"Sweetness helps to identify energy-rich foods, while bitterness serves as a warning sign of poisons.Among humans, taste perception begins to fade at an older age because of loss of tongue papillae and a general decrease in saliva production."
Humans can also have distortion of tastes (dysgeusia).
"Not all mammals share the same taste modalities: some rodents can taste starch (which humans cannot), cats cannot taste sweetness, and several other carnivores including hyenas, dolphins, and sea lions, have lost the ability to sense up to four of their ancestral five taste modalities."
"A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature."
The single feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control.
"The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.Gardens often have design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or without fish), waterfalls or creeks."
"Some gardens are for ornamental purposes only, while others also produce food crops, sometimes in separate areas, or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants."
"Food-producing gardens are distinguished from farms by their smaller scale, more labor-intensive methods, and their purpose (enjoyment of a hobby or self-sustenance rather than producing for sale, as in a  market garden)."
"Flower gardens combine plants of different heights, colors, textures, and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses."
"The most common form today is a residential or public garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one."
"Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens."
"Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden, which etymologically implies enclosure, often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden."
"Some traditional types of eastern gardens, such as Zen gardens, however, use plants sparsely or not at all."
"Landscape gardens, on the other hand, such as the English landscape gardens first developed in the 18th century, may omit flowers altogether."
Landscape architecture is a related professional activity with landscape architects tending to engage in design at many scales and working on both public and private projects.
A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument.
"Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator."
"The strike may be made by an internal ""clapper"" or ""uvula"", an external hammer, or—in small bells—by a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell)."
"Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials."
This depends on the function.
"Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal."
"Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower."
"Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters."
"Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services."
"Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom."
The study of bells is called campanology.
"A balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and air."
"For special tasks, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, granular media (e.g."
"sand, flour or rice), or light sources."
"Modern day balloons are made from materials such as rubber, latex, polychloroprene, or a nylon fabric, and can come in many different colors."
"Some early balloons were made of dried animal bladders, such as the pig bladder."
"Some balloons are used for decorative purposes or entertaining purposes, while others are used for practical purposes such as meteorology, medical treatment, military defense, or transportation."
"A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications."
"The rubber balloon was invented by Michael Faraday in 1824, during experiments with various gases."
He invented them for use in the lab.
A conjugal visit is a scheduled period in which an inmate of a prison or jail is permitted to spend several hours or days in private with a visitor.
"The visitor is usually their legal spouse, and the visit's purpose is usually sexual activity."
The generally recognized basis for permitting such visits in modern times is to preserve family bonds and increase the chances of success for a prisoner's eventual return to ordinary life after release from prison.
They also provide an incentive to inmates to comply with the various day-to-day rules and regulations of the prison.
"Conjugal visits usually take place in designated rooms or a structure provided for that purpose, such as a trailer or a small cabin."
"Supplies such as soap, condoms, lubricant, bed linens, and towels may be provided."
"Rhythm (from Greek ῥυθμός, rhythmos, ""any regular recurring motion, symmetry"" generally means a ""movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions""."
"This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years."
"Rhythm is related to and distinguished from pulse, meter, and beats:

Rhythm may be defined as the way in which one or more unaccented beats are grouped in relation to an accented one."
"... A rhythmic group can be apprehended only when its elements are distinguished from one another, rhythm...always involves an interrelationship between a single, accented (strong) beat and either one or two unaccented (weak) beats."
"In the performance arts, rhythm is the timing of events on a human scale; of musical sounds and silences that occur over time, of the steps of a dance, or the meter of spoken language and poetry."
"In some performing arts, such as hip hop music, the rhythmic delivery of the lyrics is one of the most important elements of the style."
"Rhythm may also refer to visual presentation, as ""timed movement through space"" and a common language of pattern unites rhythm with geometry."
"For example, architects often speak of the rhythm of a building, referring to patterns in the spacing of windows, columns, and other elements of the façade."
"In recent years, rhythm and meter have become an important area of research among music scholars."
"Recent work in these areas includes books by Maury Yeston, Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, Jonathan Kramer, Christopher Hasty, Godfried Toussaint, William Rothstein, Joel Lester, and Guerino Mazzola."
"Adam John Walsh (November 14, 1974 – July 27, 1981) was an American boy who was abducted from a Sears department store at the Hollywood Mall in Hollywood, Florida on July 27, 1981."
"His severed head was found two weeks later in a drainage canal alongside Highway 60 / Yeehaw Junction in rural Indian River County, Florida."
"His death garnered national interest and was made into the 1983 television film Adam, seen by 38 million people in its original airing."
"His father, John Walsh, became an advocate for victims of violent crimes and was the host of the television program America's Most Wanted and, later, In Pursuit with John Walsh."
Convicted serial killer Ottis Toole confessed to Adam's murder but was never convicted of the crime because evidence was lost and Toole later recanted his confession.
"Toole died in prison of liver failure on September 15, 1996."
"No new evidence has come to light since then, and police announced on December 16, 2008 that the Walsh case was closed and that they were satisfied that Toole was the killer."
A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
"A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user."
"The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice."
"A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device."
"This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households."
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
"In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone."
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
"The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker."
"Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously."
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
"Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards."
"These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network."
"For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century."
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
"In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost."
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
"Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs."
"War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias."
"It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces."
"Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general."
"Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties."
"While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances."
"Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of  Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc."
"), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven."
A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
"In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork."
"In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand."
"The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania."
"Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries."
"It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food."
"Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven."
"In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias."
"Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit."
True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
"In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage."
"A marching band is a group of instrumental musicians who perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition."
"Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments."
"Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military-style, that includes an associated organization's colors, name or symbol."
"Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags, rifles, and sabres."
"Marching bands are generally categorized by function, size, age, instrumentation, marching style, and type of show they perform."
"In addition to traditional parade performances, many marching bands also perform field shows at sporting events and marching band competitions."
"Increasingly, marching bands perform indoor concerts that implement many songs, traditions, and flair from outside performances."
"In some cases, at higher level competitions, bands will be placed into classes based on school size."
"Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā, ""heart"" and -λογία -logia, ""study"") is a branch of medicine that deals with the disorders of the heart as well as some parts of the circulatory system."
"The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology."
"Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a specialty of internal medicine."
Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology.
"Physicians who specialize in cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons, a specialty of general surgery."
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"In its broad sense, a territory is ""an area of land; a region"", but in its narrower sense it is ""a geographic region, such as a colonial possession, that is dependent on an external government."""
A territory as an administrative division is usually an area that is under the jurisdiction of a sovereign state.
"In most countries, a territory is an organized division of an area that is controlled by a country but is not formally developed into, or incorporated into, a political unit of the country that is of equal status to other political units that may often be referred to by words such as ""provinces"" or ""regions"" or ""states""."
"In international politics, a territory is usually either the total area from which a state may extract power resources or any non-sovereign geographic area which has come under the authority of another government; which has not been granted the powers of self-government normally devolved to secondary territorial divisions; or both."
"A twig or stick is a thin, often short, branch of a tree or bush.The buds on the twig are an important diagnostic characteristic, as are the abscission scars where the leaves have fallen away."
"The color, texture, and patterning of the twig bark are also important, in addition to the thickness and nature of any pith of the twig."
There are two types of twig: vegetative twigs and fruiting spurs.
"Fruiting spurs are specialized twigs that generally branch off the sides of branches and are stubby and slow-growing, with many annular ring markings from seasons past."
"The age and rate of growth of a twig can be determined by counting the winter terminal bud scale scars, or annular ring marking, down the length of the twig."
A governing body is a group of people that has the authority to exercise governance over an organization or political entity.
"The most formal is a government, a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a taken geopolitical system (such as a state) by establishing laws."
"Other types of governing include an organization (such as a corporation recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, family, religious denomination, etc."
"), or another, informal group of people."
"In business and outsourcing relationships, governance frameworks are built into relational contracts that foster long-term collaboration and innovation."
"A board of governors is often the governing body of a public institution, while a board of directors typically serves as the governing body of a corporation or other company larger or more complex than a partnership."
Many professional sports have a sports governing body that serves as their regulating authority.
"Governing bodies can vary widely in size, which is ""important not only for acquiring the necessary range of skills to oversee the entity, but also in promoting cohesion, flexibility, and effective participation of the members to achieve their governance objectives""."
"A governing body is only one component of a system of governance, which also requires a written framework under which the body must operate, and governance mechanisms to both carry out directives of the governing body, and to report information back to the governing body."
"A wrinkle, also known as a rhytide, is a fold, ridge or crease in an otherwise smooth surface, such as on skin or fabric."
"Skin wrinkles typically appear as a result of ageing processes such as glycation,  habitual sleeping positions, loss of body mass, sun damage, or temporarily, as the result of prolonged immersion in water."
"Age wrinkling in the skin is promoted by habitual facial expressions, aging, sun damage, smoking, poor hydration, and various other factors."
"In humans, it can also be prevented to some degree by avoiding excessive solar exposure and through diet (in particular through consumption of carotenoids, tocopherols and flavonoids, vitamins (A, C, D and E), essential omega-3-fatty acids, certain proteins and lactobacilli."
A whip is a tool designed to strike humans or other animals to exert control through pain compliance or fear of pain.
"They can also be used without inflicting pain, for audiovisual cues, such as in equestrianism."
"They are generally either a firm stick designed for direct contact, or a flexible line requiring a specialized swing."
"The former is easier and more precise, the latter offers longer reach and greater force."
A hunting whip combines a firm stick (the stock or handle) with a flexible line (the lash or thong).
"Whips such as the ""cat o' nine tails"" and knout are specifically developed for flagellation as a means of inflicting corporal punishment or torture on human targets."
Certain religious practices and BDSM activities involve the self-use of whips or the use of whips between consenting partners.
"Misuse on non-humans may be considered animal cruelty, and misuse on humans may be viewed as assault."
"A hovercraft, also known as an air-cushion vehicle or ACV, is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice, and other surfaces."
"Hovercraft use blowers to produce a large volume of air below the hull, or air cushion, that is slightly above atmospheric pressure."
"The pressure difference between the higher pressure air below the hull and lower pressure ambient air above it produces lift, which causes the hull to float above the running surface."
"For stability reasons, the air is typically blown through slots or holes around the outside of a disk- or oval-shaped platform, giving most hovercraft a characteristic rounded-rectangle shape."
The first practical design for hovercraft was derived from a British invention in the 1950s.
"They are now used throughout the world as specialised transports in disaster relief, coastguard, military and survey applications, as well as for sport or passenger service."
"Very large versions have been used to transport hundreds of people and vehicles across the English Channel, whilst others have military applications used to transport tanks, soldiers and large equipment in hostile environments and terrain."
"Decline in public demand meant that as of 2021, the only public hovercraft service in the world still in operation serves between the Isle of Wight and Southsea in the UK.Although now a generic term for the type of craft, the name Hovercraft itself was a trademark owned by Saunders-Roe (later British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC), then Westland), hence other manufacturers' use of alternative names to describe the vehicles."
The standard plural of hovercraft is hovercraft (in the same manner that aircraft is both singular and plural).
"Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators."
"Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health."
"Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals."
"In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other."
"Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser."
A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
"Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs."
"Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition."
"Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports."
"However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports."
"The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner."
Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.
"It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression."
"Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news."
"Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting."
"Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport."
"According to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013."
"The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport."
"A meeting is when two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal or business setting, but meetings also occur in a variety of other environments."
Meetings can be used as form of group decision making.
"""I Care"" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Tom T. Hall."
"It was released in December 1974 as the only single from the album, Songs of Fox Hollow."
"""I Care"" was Hall's sixth number one on the U.S. country singles chart."
The single had a one-week stay at number one and remained on the chart for a total of ten weeks.
"Toward; (Scottish Gaelic: Tollard) is a village near Dunoon, Scotland, at the southern tip of the Cowal peninsula."
"During the Second World War, the Toward area was a training centre called HMS Brontosaurus also known as the No 2 Combined Training Centre (CTC), based at Castle Toward."
"Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development."
"Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research."
"Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves."
"Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational."
The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
"Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship."
"In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age."
"There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies."
A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.
"Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all."
Candyass is the debut album by American industrial rock band Orgy.
"It was released on August 18, 1998."
"A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered appendage located at the end of the forearm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs."
"A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each ""hand"" and fingerprints extremely similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having ""hands"" instead of paws on their front limbs."
"The raccoon is usually described as having ""hands"" though opposable thumbs are lacking.Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generally — for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand.The human hand usually has five digits: four fingers plus one thumb; these are often referred to collectively as five fingers, however, whereby the thumb is included as one of the fingers."
"It has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bone, the number of which varies among people, 14 of which are the phalanges (proximal, intermediate and distal) of the fingers and thumb."
The metacarpal bones connect the fingers and the carpal bones of the wrist.
Each human hand has five metacarpals and eight carpal bones.
"Fingers contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings in the body, and are the richest source of tactile feedback."
"They also have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus, the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands."
"Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs) each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness—the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning."
"Among humans, the hands play an important function in body language and sign language."
"Likewise, the ten digits of two hands and the twelve phalanges of four fingers (touchable by the thumb) have given rise to number systems and calculation techniques."
"A sled dog is a dog trained and used to pull a land vehicle in harness, most commonly a sled over snow."
"Sled dogs have been used in the Arctic for at least 8,000 years and, along with watercraft, were the only transportation in Arctic areas until the introduction of semi-trailer trucks, snowmobiles and airplanes in the 20th century, hauling supplies in areas that were inaccessible by other methods."
"They were used with varying success in the explorations of both poles, as well as during the Alaskan gold rush."
"Sled dog teams delivered mail to rural communities in Alaska, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut."
"Sled dogs today are still used by some rural communities, especially in areas of Russia, Canada, and Alaska as well as much of Greenland."
"They are used for recreational purposes and racing events, such as the Iditarod Trail and the Yukon Quest."
"A bareboat charter or demise charter is an arrangement for the chartering or hiring of a ship or boat, whereby no crew or provisions are included as part of the agreement; instead, the people who rent the vessel from the owner are responsible for taking care of such things."
"This act is commonly known as bareboating or bareboat charter.There are legal differences between a bareboat charter and other types of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters."
"In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time."
"In these charters, the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew."
"In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew."
"The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a ""disponent owner""."
The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"Description is the pattern of narrative development that aims to make vivid a place, object, character, or group."
"Description is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, argumentation, and narration."
In practice it would be difficult to write literature that drew on just one of the four basic modes.
"A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a behavioral or mental pattern that causes significant distress or impairment of personal functioning."
"Such features may be persistent, relapsing and remitting, or occur as single episodes."
"Many disorders have been described, with signs and symptoms that vary widely between specific disorders."
"Such disorders may be diagnosed by a mental health professional, usually a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist."
The causes of mental disorders are often unclear.
Theories may incorporate findings from a range of fields.
"Mental disorders are usually defined by a combination of how a person behaves, feels, perceives, or thinks."
"This may be associated with particular regions or functions of the brain, often in a social context."
A mental disorder is one aspect of mental health.
"Cultural and religious beliefs, as well as social norms, should be taken into account when making a diagnosis.Services are based in psychiatric hospitals or in the community, and assessments are carried out by mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses and clinical social workers, using various methods such as psychometric tests but often relying on observation and questioning."
Treatments are provided by various mental health professionals.
Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options.
"Other treatments include lifestyle changes, social interventions, peer support, and self-help."
"In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or treatment."
"Prevention programs have been shown to reduce depression.In 2019, common mental disorders around the globe include depression, which affects about 264 million, bipolar disorder, which affects about 45 million, dementia, which affects about 50 million, and schizophrenia and other psychoses, which affects about 20 million people."
Neurodevelopmental disorders include intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders which usually arise in infancy or childhood.
"Stigma and discrimination can add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders, leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion."
Thunder is the sound caused by lightning.
"Depending upon the distance from and nature of the lightning, it can range from a long, low rumble to a sudden, loud crack."
The sudden increase in temperature and hence pressure caused by the lightning produces rapid expansion of the air in the path of a lightning bolt.
"In turn, this expansion of air creates a sonic shock wave, often referred to as a ""thunderclap"" or ""peal of thunder""."
The study of thunder is known as brontology.
"A patrol is commonly a group of personnel, such as law enforcement officers, military personnel, or private security contractors that are assigned to monitor a specific geographic area."
This is also often referred to as a beat.
"Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, typically of nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding."
"The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat."
"The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called ""runs""."
"The objective of the defensive team (fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases."
A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).
The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.
The first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base safely.
"A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called ""out"" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting."
"The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners ""out"", which forces them out of the field of play."
Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out.
The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs.
One turn batting for each team constitutes an inning.
"A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins."
"If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually played."
"Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning."
Baseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century.
"This game was brought by immigrants to North America, where the modern version developed."
"By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States."
"Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan."
"In the United States and Canada, professional Major League Baseball (MLB) teams are divided into the National League (NL) and American League (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central."
The MLB champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series.
The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League.
"The World Baseball Classic, organized by the World Baseball Softball Confederation, is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world."
A  battle  is an occurrence of combat in warfare between opposing military units of any number or size.
A war usually consists of multiple battles.
"In general, a battle is a military engagement that is well defined in duration, area, and force commitment."
An engagement with only limited commitment between the forces and without decisive results is sometimes called a skirmish.
"The word ""battle"" can also be used infrequently to refer to an entire operational campaign, although this usage greatly diverges from its conventional or customary meaning."
"Generally, the word ""battle"" is used for such campaigns if referring to a protracted combat encounter in which either one or both of the combatants had the same methods, resources, and strategic objectives throughout  the encounter."
"Some prominent examples of this would be the Battle of the Atlantic, Battle of Britain, and Battle of Stalingrad, all in World War II."
"Wars and military campaigns are guided by military strategy, whereas battles take place on a level of planning and execution known as operational mobility."
"German strategist Carl von Clausewitz stated that ""the employment of battles ... to achieve the object of war"" was the essence of strategy."
Cowardice is a trait wherein excessive fear prevents an individual from taking a risk or facing danger.
It is the opposite of courage.
"As a label, ""cowardice""  indicates a failure of character in the face of a challenge."
"One who succumbs to cowardice is known as a coward.The United States military codes of justice proscribe cowardice in combat as a crime punishable by death (note the phrase ""shot at dawn"").As the opposite of an action or trait that many existing and formerly extant cultures demand, cowardice rates as a character flaw that many societies and their representatives stigmatize and/or punish."
"A book is a medium for recording information in the form of writing or images, typically composed of many pages (made of papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) bound together and protected by a cover."
"The technical term for this physical arrangement is codex (plural, codices)."
"In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its predecessor, the scroll."
A single sheet in a codex is a leaf and each side of a leaf is a page.
"As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and still considered as an investment of time to read."
"In a restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage reflecting that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained."
Each part of Aristotle's Physics is called a book.
"In an unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts."
"The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even be called a book."
"Books can consist only of drawings, engravings or photographs, crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls."
"In a physical book, the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines to support entries, such as in an account book, an appointment book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or a sketchbook."
"Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album."
Books may be distributed in electronic form as ebooks and other formats.
"Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a scholarly subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume In Search of Lost Time), in contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal or newspaper."
"An avid reader or collector of books is a bibliophile or colloquially, ""bookworm""."
A place where books are traded is a bookshop or bookstore.
Books are also sold elsewhere and can be borrowed from libraries.
"Google has estimated that by 2010, approximately 130,000,000 titles had been published."
"In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the increased usage of ebooks."
"A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred."
"The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, ""sleeping place"") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs."
"The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an ""above-ground grave"" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice."
"In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries."
These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs.
"Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled."
"Owe is a surname or given name, a spelling variation of Ove."
"Notable people with the name include: 

Baard Owe (born 1936), Norwegian-born actor
Owe Adamson (born 1935), Swedish cyclist and Olympic competitor
Owe Hellberg (born 1953), Swedish Left Party politician
Owe Jonsson (1940–1962), Swedish sprinter, ice hockey and bandy player

Owe Ohlsson (born 1938), Swedish footballer and manager
Owe Thörnqvist (born 1929), Swedish troubadour, revue artist and songwriter
Owe Wiktorin (born 1940), Swedish General"
"A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae)."
"The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs."
Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
The two types of pollination are: self-pollination and cross-pollination.
"Self-pollination happens when the pollen from the anther is deposited on the stigma of the same flower, or another flower on the same plant."
Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.
"Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma."
This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy).
Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop.
"Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen."
"After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds."
"In addition to facilitating the reproduction of flowering plants, flowers have long been admired and used by humans to bring beauty to their environment, and also as objects of romance, ritual, esotericism, witchcraft, religion, medicine, and as a source of food."
"In Games Workshop's Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 fictional universes, Chaos refers to the parasitic entities which live in a different plane of reality, known as the Warp or Immaterium in Warhammer 40,000 and as the Realm of Chaos in Warhammer Age of Sigmar."
"The term can refer to these warp entities and their influence, the servants and worshippers of these entities, or even the parallel universe in which these entities are supposed to reside."
"The most powerful of these warp entities are those known as the Chaos Gods, also sometimes referred to as the Dark Gods, Ruinous Powers, or the Powers of Chaos."
"Similarities exist between the Warhammer idea of Chaos and the concept of Chaos from Michael Moorcock's Elric saga, which also influenced D&D's alignment system."
Further similarities can be seen with the godlike extradimensional Great Old Ones of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's stories.
"A bathroom or washroom is a room, typically in a home or other residential building, that contains either a bathtub or a shower (or both)."
The inclusion of a wash basin is common.
In some parts of the world e.g.
"India, a toilet is typically included in the bathroom; in others, the toilet is typically given a dedicated room separate from the one allocated for personal hygiene activities."
"In North American English the word 'bathroom' is sometimes used to refer to any room in a residence that contains a toilet, regardless of the inclusion of a bath or shower."
"Historically, bathing was often a collective activity, which took place in public baths."
"In some countries the shared social aspect of cleansing the body is still important, as for example with sento in Japan and the ""Turkish bath"" (also known by other names) throughout the Islamic world."
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid.
"Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils."
A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio.
The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing.
A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.
"Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils."
"Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics."
"Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines."
Rowing is the act of propelling a boat using the motion of oars in the water by displacing water to propel the boat forward.
Rowing and paddling are similar.
"However, rowing requires oars to have a mechanical connection with the boat, while paddles (used for paddling) are hand-held and have no mechanical connection."
"In some strict terminologies, using oars for propulsion may be termed either ""pulling"" or ""rowing"", with different definitions for each."
"Where these strict terminologies are used, the definitions are reversed depending on the context: on salt water a pulling boat has one person working each oar, whilst rowing means each person operates two oars on either side of the boat."
"On inland waterways, the opposite applies, with rowing being where each person in a crew works one oar."
"Similarly ""sculling"" can mean propelling a boat with a single oar operated over the stern or, especially in sport rowing, each person operating two oars."
": 135 : 226–227 This article focuses on the general types of rowing, such as recreation and transport rather than the sport of competitive rowing which is a specialized case of racing using strictly regulated equipment and a highly refined technique."
"A check mark (American English), checkmark (Philippine English), tickmark (Indian English) or tick (Australian, New Zealand English, and British English) is a mark (✓, ✔, etc.)"
"used, primarily in the English-speaking world, to indicate the concept ""yes"" (e.g."
"""yes; this has been verified"", ""yes; that is the correct answer"", ""yes; this has been completed"", or ""yes; this [item or option] applies to me"")."
"The x mark is also sometimes used for this purpose (most notably on election ballot papers, e.g."
"in the United Kingdom), but otherwise usually indicates ""no"", incorrectness, or failure."
"One of the earliest usages of a check mark as an indication of completion is on ancient Babylonian tablets ""where small indentations were sometimes made with a stylus, usually placed at the left of a worker's name, presumably to indicate whether the listed ration has been issued."
"""As a verb, to check (off) or tick (off), means to add such a mark."
"Printed forms, printed documents, and computer software (see checkbox), commonly include squares in which to place check marks."
Ballet (French: [balɛ]) is a type of performance dance that originated during the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia.
It has since become a widespread and highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary.
Ballet has been influential globally and has defined the foundational techniques which are used in many other dance genres and cultures.
Various schools around the world have incorporated their own cultures.
"As a result, ballet has evolved in distinct ways."
A ballet as a unified work comprises the choreography and music for a ballet production.
Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers.
"Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and using elaborate costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets are often performed in simple costumes and without elaborate sets or scenery."
"In linguistics and grammar, affirmation and negation (abbreviated respectively AFF and NEG) are the ways that grammar encodes positive and negative polarity in verb phrases, clauses, or other utterances."
"Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or truth of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity."
"Examples are the sentences ""Jane is here"" and ""Jane is not here""; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative."
The grammatical category associated with affirmative and negative is called polarity.
"This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc."
may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative).
"Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as English not, an affix such as Japanese -nai, or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the predicate."
"The process of converting affirmative to negative is called negation – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so."
"Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to questions) are often expressed using particles or words such as yes and no, where yes is the affirmative and no the negative particle."
"The Granary Burying Ground in Massachusetts is the city of Boston's third-oldest cemetery, founded in 1660 and located on Tremont Street."
"It is the final resting place for many notable Revolutionary War-era patriots, including Paul Revere, the five victims of the Boston Massacre, and three signers of the Declaration of Independence: Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine."
"The cemetery has 2,345 grave-markers, but historians estimate that as many as 5,000 people are buried in it."
"The cemetery is adjacent to Park Street Church, behind the Boston Athenaeum and immediately across from Suffolk University Law School."
It is a site on Boston's Freedom Trail.
"The cemetery's Egyptian revival gate and fence were designed by architect Isaiah Rogers (1800–1869), who designed  an identical gate for Newport's Touro Cemetery."
"A rubber band (also known as an elastic band, gum band or lacky band) is a loop of rubber, usually ring or oval shaped, and commonly used to hold multiple objects together."
"The rubber band was patented in England on March 17, 1845 by Stephen Perry."
"Most rubber bands are manufactured out of natural rubber or, especially at larger sizes, an elastomer, and are sold in a variety of sizes."
"Notable developments in the evolution of rubber bands began in 1923 when William H. Spencer obtained a few Goodyear inner tubes and cut the bands by hand in his basement, where he founded Alliance Rubber Company."
Spencer persuaded the Akron Beacon Journal as well as the Tulsa World to try wrapping their newspapers with one of his rubber bands to prevent them from blowing across lawns.
He went on to pioneer other new markets for rubber bands such as: agricultural and industrial applications and a myriad of other uses.
"Spencer obtained a patent on February 19, 1957 for a new ""Method for Making Elastic Bands"" which produced rubber bands in an Open Ring design."
"A generalized tonic–clonic seizure, commonly known as a grand mal seizure or GTCS, is a type of generalized seizure that produces bilateral, convulsive tonic and clonic muscle contractions."
Tonic–clonic seizures are the seizure type most commonly associated with epilepsy and seizures in general and the most common seizure associated with metabolic imbalances.
"It is a misconception that they are the sole type of seizure, as they are the main seizure type in approximately 10% of those with epilepsy.These seizures typically initiate abruptly with either a focal or generalized onset."
A prodrome (a vague sense of impending seizure) may also be present before the seizure begins.
"The seizure itself includes both tonic and clonic contractions, with tonic contractions usually preceding clonic contractions."
"After these series of contractions, there is an extended postictal state where the person is unresponsive and commonly sleeping with loud snoring."
There is usually pronounced confusion upon awakening.
The ocean (also the sea or the world ocean) is the body of salt water that covers approximately 70.8% of the surface of Earth and contains 97% of Earth's water.
"Another definition is ""any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided""."
"Separate names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific (the largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest)."
"Seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) of the planet."
"The ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, and therefore integral to life on Earth."
"Acting as a huge  heat reservoir, the ocean influences climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle."
Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.
The pelagic zone consists of the water column from surface to ocean floor throughout the open ocean.
The water column is further categorized in other zones depending on depth and on how much light is present.
"The photic zone includes water from the surface to a depth of 1% of the surface light (about 200 m in the open ocean), where photosynthesis can occur."
This makes the photic zone the most biodiverse.
"Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) creates organic matter using light, water, carbon dioxide, and nutrients."
Ocean photosynthesis creates 50% of the oxygen in earth's atmosphere.
This upper sunlit zone is the origin of the food supply which sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.
Light only penetrates to a depth of a few hundred meters; the remaining ocean below is cold and dark.
"The continental shelf where the ocean approaches dry land is more shallow, with a depth of a few hundred meters or less."
Human activity has a greater impact on the continental shelf.
Ocean temperatures depend on the amount of solar radiation reaching the ocean surface.
"In the tropics, surface temperatures can rise to over 30 °C (86 °F)."
"Near the poles where sea ice forms, the temperature in equilibrium is about −2 °C (28 °F)."
Deep seawater temperature is between −2 °C (28 °F) and 5 °C (41 °F) in all parts of the ocean.
Water continuously circulates in the oceans creating ocean currents.
"These directed movements of seawater are generated by forces acting upon the water, including temperature differences, atmospheric circulation (wind), the Coriolis effect and differences in salinity."
"Tidal currents originate from tides, while surface currents are caused by wind and waves."
"Major ocean currents include the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio current, Agulhas current and Antarctic Circumpolar Current."
"Collectively, currents move enormous amounts of water and heat around the globe."
This circulation significantly impacts global climate and the uptake and redistribution of pollutants such as carbon dioxide by moving these contaminants from the surface into the deep ocean.
"Ocean water contains large quantities of dissolved gases, including oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen."
This gas exchange takes place at the ocean surface and solubility depends on the temperature and salinity of the water.
"The increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to fossil fuel combustion leads to higher concentrations in ocean water, resulting in ocean acidification."
"The ocean provides society with important environmental services, including climate regulation."
It also offers a means of trade and transport and access to  food and other resources.
"Known to be the habitat of over 230,000 species, it may contain far more – perhaps over two million species."
"However, the ocean is subject to numerous environmental threats, including marine pollution, overfishing, ocean acidification and other effects of climate change."
The continental shelf and coastal waters that are most influenced by human activity are especially vulnerable.
"A sister is a woman or girl who shares one or more parents with another individual, a sibling."
The male counterpart is a brother.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full sister is a first degree relative.
"In physics, mathematics, and related fields, a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance (change from equilibrium) of one or more quantities, sometimes as described by a wave equation."
"In physical waves, at least two field quantities in the wave medium are involved."
"Waves can be periodic, in which case those quantities oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium (resting) value at some frequency."
"When the entire waveform moves in one direction it is said to be a traveling wave; by contrast, a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave."
"In a standing wave, the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero."
The types of waves most commonly studied in classical physics are mechanical and electromagnetic.
"In a mechanical wave, stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium."
A mechanical wave is a local deformation (strain) in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too.
"For example, sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium."
"Other examples of mechanical waves are seismic waves, gravity waves, surface waves, string vibrations (standing waves), and vortices."
"In an electromagnetic wave (such as light), coupling between the electric and magnetic fields which sustains propagation of a wave involving these fields according to Maxwell's equations."
Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some dielectric media (at wavelengths where they are considered transparent).
"Electromagnetic waves, according to their frequencies (or wavelengths) have more specific designations including radio waves, infrared radiation, terahertz waves, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays."
"Other types of waves include gravitational waves, which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity; heat diffusion waves; plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields; reaction–diffusion waves, such as in the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction; and many more."
"Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer energy, momentum, and information, but they do not transfer particles in the medium."
In mathematics and electronics waves are studied as signals.
"On the other hand, some waves have envelopes which do not move at all such as standing waves (which are fundamental to music) and hydraulic jumps."
"Some, like the probability waves of quantum mechanics, may be completely static."
"A physical wave is almost always confined to some finite region of space, called its domain."
"For example, the seismic waves generated by earthquakes are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet, so they can be ignored outside it."
"However, waves with infinite domain, that extend over the whole space, are commonly studied in mathematics, and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains."
A plane wave is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any (infinite) plane normal to a specific direction of travel.
"Mathematically, the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency."
"In linear media, complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and/or different frequencies."
A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation (also the direction of energy transfer); or longitudinal if those vectors are exactly in the propagation direction.
Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves; on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids (such as air) can only be longitudinal.
That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave's polarization which can be an important attribute for waves having more than one single possible polarization.
"A chemical plant is an industrial process plant that manufactures (or otherwise processes) chemicals, usually on a large scale."
The general objective of a chemical plant is to create new material wealth via the chemical or biological transformation and or separation of materials.
"Chemical plants use specialized equipment, units, and technology in the manufacturing process."
"Other kinds of plants, such as polymer, pharmaceutical, food, and some beverage production facilities, power plants, oil refineries or other refineries, natural gas processing and biochemical plants, water and wastewater treatment, and pollution control equipment use many technologies that have similarities to chemical plant technology such as fluid systems and chemical reactor systems."
Some would consider an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical or polymer manufacturer to be effectively a chemical plant.
Petrochemical plants (plants using chemicals from petroleum as a raw material or  feedstock) are usually located adjacent to an oil refinery to minimize transportation costs for the feedstocks produced by the refinery.
Speciality chemical and fine chemical plants are usually much smaller and not as sensitive to location.
Tools have been developed for converting a base project cost from one geographic location to another.
"Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes ."
"Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales."
"Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws."
"To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung."
Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
"Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards."
"These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae)."
"Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans."
"Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans."
"More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species."
"They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length."
The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.
"Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago."
"The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)."
The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.
Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans.
Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
"The word day has a number of meanings, depending on the context it is used such as of astronomy, physics, and various calendar systems."
"As a term in physics and astronomy it is approximately the period during which the Earth completes one rotation around its axis, which takes about 24 hours."
A solar day is the length of time which elapses between the Sun reaching its highest point in the sky two consecutive times.
"Days on other planets are defined similarly and vary in length due to differing rotation periods, that of Mars being slightly longer and sometimes called a sol."
"The unit of measurement ""day"" (symbol d) is defined as 86,400 SI seconds."
The second is designated the SI base unit of time.
"Previously, it was defined in terms of the orbital motion of the Earth in the year 1900, but since 1967 the second and so the day are defined by atomic electron transition."
"A civil day is usually 24 hours, plus or minus a possible leap second in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), and occasionally plus or minus an hour in those locations that change from or to daylight saving time."
"Day can be defined as each of the twenty-four-hour periods, reckoned from one midnight to the next, into which a week, month, or year is divided, and corresponding to a rotation of the earth on its axis."
"However, its use depends on its context; for example, when people say 'day and night', 'day' will have a different meaning: the interval of light between two successive nights, the time between sunrise and sunset; the time of light between one night and the next."
"For clarity when meaning 'day' in that sense, the word ""daytime"" may be used instead, though context and phrasing often makes the meaning clear."
"The word day may also refer to a day of the week or to a calendar date, as in answer to the question, ""On which day?"""
The biologically determined living patterns (circadian rhythms) of humans and many other species relate to Earth's solar day and the day-night cycle.
"A guide book or travel guide is ""a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists""."
"It will usually include information about sights, accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities."
Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included.
"Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from adventure travel to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet."
Travel guides can also take the form of travel websites.
"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
Intentions are mental states in which the agent commits themselves to a course of action.
Having the plan to visit the zoo tomorrow is an example of an intention.
The action plan is the content of the intention while the commitment is the attitude towards this content.
"Other mental states can have action plans as their content, as when one admires a plan, but differ from intentions since they do not involve a practical commitment to realizing this plan."
Successful intentions bring about the intended course of action while unsuccessful intentions fail to do so.
"Intentions, like many other mental states, have intentionality: they represent possible states of affairs."
Theories of intention try to capture the characteristic features of intentions.
The belief-desire theory is the traditionally dominant approach.
"According to a simple version of it, having an intention is nothing but having a desire to perform a certain action and a belief that one will perform this action."
"Belief-desire theories are frequently criticized based on the fact that neither beliefs nor desires involve a practical commitment to performing an action, which is often illustrated in various counterexamples."
The evaluation theory tries to overcome this problem by explaining intentions in terms of unconditional evaluations.
"That is to say that intentions do not just present the intended course of action as good in some respect, as is the case for desires, but as good all things considered."
"This approach has problems in explaining cases of akrasia, i.e."
that agents do not always intend what they see as the best course of action.
A closely related theory identifies intentions not with unconditional evaluations but with predominant desires.
It states that intending to do something consists in desiring it the most.
Opponents of this approach have articulated various counterexamples with the goal of showing that intentions do not always coincide with the agent's strongest desire.
A different approach to the theories mentioned so far is due to Elizabeth Anscombe and denies the distinction between intentions and actions.
"On her view, to intend a goal is already a form of acting towards this goal and therefore not a distinct mental state."
"This account struggles to explain cases in which intentions and actions seem to come apart, as when the agent is not currently doing anything towards realizing their plan or in the case of failed actions."
"The self-referentiality theory suggests that intentions are self-referential, i.e."
that they do not just represent the intended course of action but also represent themselves as the cause of the action.
But the claim that this happens on the level of the content of the intention has been contested.
"The term ""intention"" refers to a group of related phenomena."
"For this reason, theorists often distinguish various types of intentions in order to avoid misunderstandings."
The most-discussed distinction is that between prospective and immediate intentions.
"Prospective intentions, also known as ""prior intentions"", involve plans for the future."
They can be subdivided according to how far they plan ahead: proximal intentions involve plans for what one wants to do straightaway whereas distal intentions are concerned with a more remote future.
"Immediate intentions, on the other hand, are intentions that guide the agent while they are performing the action in question."
"They are also called  ""intentions-in-action"" or ""act-related"" intentions."
"The term ""intention"" usually refers to anticipated means or ends that motivate the agent."
"But in some cases, it can refer to anticipated side-effects that are neither means nor ends to the agent."
"In this case, the term ""oblique intention"" is sometimes used."
Intentions are rationally evaluable: they are either rational or irrational.
"Conscious intentions are the paradigmatic form of intention: in them, the agent is aware of their goals."
But it has been suggested that actions can also be guided by unconscious intentions of which the agent is not aware.
"The formation of intentions is sometimes preceded by the deliberation of promising alternative courses of action and may happen in decisions, in which the agent chooses between these alternatives."
"Intentions are responsible for initiating, sustaining, and terminating actions and are frequently used to explain why people engage in a certain behavior."
Understanding the behavior of others in terms of intentions already happens in early childhood.
"Important in this context is the role of gestures, pointing, attention, and eye movement to understand the intentions of others and to form shared intentions."
"In the philosophy of action, a central question is whether it is true for all intentional actions that they are caused or accompanied by intentions."
The theory of reasoned action aims to predict behavior based on how pre-existing attitudes and subjective norms determine behavioral intentions.
"In ethics, the intention principle states that whether an action is morally permissible sometimes depends on the agent's intention for performing this action."
"A hairstyle, hairdo, haircut or coiffure refers to the styling of hair, usually on the human scalp."
"Sometimes, this could also mean an editing of facial or body hair."
"The fashioning of hair can be considered an aspect of personal grooming, fashion, and cosmetics, although practical, cultural, and popular considerations also influence some hairstyles.The oldest known depiction of hair styling is hair braiding which dates back about 30,000 years."
"In history, women's hair was often elaborately and carefully dressed in special ways, though it was also often kept covered outside the home, especially for married women."
"From the time of the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, most women grew their hair as long as it would naturally grow."
"Between the late 15th century and the 16th century, a very high hairline on the forehead was considered attractive."
"Around the same time period, European men often wore their hair cropped no longer than shoulder-length."
"In the early 17th century, male hairstyles grew longer, with waves or curls being considered desirable."
The male wig was pioneered by King Louis XIII of France (1601–1643) in 1624.
Mullets or periwigs for men were introduced into the English-speaking world with other French styles in 1660.
"Late 17th century wigs were very long and wavy, but became shorter in the mid-18th century, by which time they were normally white."
Short hair for fashionable men was a product of the Neoclassical movement.
"In the early 19th century the male beard, and also moustaches and sideburns, made a strong reappearance."
"From the 16th to the 19th century, European women's hair became more visible while their hair coverings grew smaller."
In the middle of the 18th century the pouf style developed.
"During the First World War, women around the world started to shift to shorter hairstyles that were easier to manage."
In the early 1950s women's hair was generally curled and worn in a variety of styles and lengths.
"In the 1960s, many women began to wear their hair in short modern cuts such as the pixie cut, while in the 1970s, hair tended to be longer and looser."
In both the 1960s and 1970s many men and women wore their hair very long and straight.
"In the 1980s, women pulled back their hair with scrunchies."
"During the 1980s, punk hairstyles were adopted by many people."
"A cape is a clothing accessory or a sleeveless outer garment which drapes the wearer's back, arms, and chest, and connects at the neck."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
"Thebe Neruda Kgositsile (born February 24, 1994), also known by his stage name Earl Sweatshirt, is an American rapper, songwriter, and record producer."
"Kgositsile was originally known by the moniker Sly Tendencies when he began rapping in 2008, but soon changed his name when Tyler, the Creator invited him to join his alternative hip hop collective Odd Future in late 2009."
"He gained recognition and critical praise for his debut mixtape, Earl, which he released in March 2010, at the young age of 16."
"Shortly after its release, his mother sent him to a boarding school in Samoa for at-risk teens for a year and a half."
"He was unable to record music during his tenure there, but returned to Los Angeles in February 2012, just before his eighteenth birthday."
"Kgositsile rejoined Odd Future and started producing new music, releasing his debut studio album, Doris, in August 2013.His second album, I Don't Like Shit, I Don't Go Outside, followed in March 2015, and his third, Some Rap Songs, released in November 2018."
His projects have all received widespread critical praise.
"He is currently signed to his independent label Tan Cressida, which was formerly distributed by Columbia Records."
"On November 1, 2019, Kgositsile released an EP titled Feet of Clay."
Eyes are organs of the visual system.
"They provide living organisms with vision, the ability to receive and process visual detail, as well as enabling several photo response functions that are independent of vision."
Eyes detect light and convert it into electro-chemical impulses in neurons.
"In higher organisms, the eye is a complex optical system which collects light from the surrounding environment, regulates its intensity through a diaphragm, focuses it through an adjustable assembly of lenses to form an image, converts this image into a set of electrical signals, and transmits these signals to the brain through complex neural pathways that connect the eye via the optic nerve to the visual cortex and other areas of the brain."
"Eyes with resolving power have come in ten fundamentally different forms, and 96% of animal species possess a complex optical system."
"Image-resolving eyes are present in molluscs, chordates and arthropods.The most simple eyes, pit eyes, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eye-spot, to allow the organism to deduce the angle of incoming light."
"From more complex eyes, retinal photosensitive ganglion cells send signals along the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to effect circadian adjustment and to the pretectal area to control the pupillary light reflex."
Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.
"They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans."
"Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere."
"Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia."
"Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails."
"While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets."
"With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals."
They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.
"Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers."
"Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days."
"Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance."
"With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies."
"In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market."
"The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries."
"The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing."
"A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory.In the past, hats were an indicator of social status."
"In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment."
"Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police."
Some hats have a protective function.
"As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm."
"Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies."
"Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs."
"Some hats have religious functions, such as the mitres worn by Bishops and the turban worn by Sikhs."
"The Revivalists are an American rock band formed in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2007."
"The eight-piece band consists of Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar, guitar), David Shaw (lead vocals), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), George Gekas (bass guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums and percussion), Michael Girardot (keyboards and trumpet), and Paulet ""PJ"" Howard (drums and percussion)."
"After The Revivalists released their album, Men Amongst Mountains, on July 17, 2015, they were named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of ""10 Bands You Need to Know""."
"In September 2016, their song ""Wish I Knew You"" reached No."
"1 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart, and in May 2017, the song reached No."
1 on the Alternative Songs chart.
"On September 11, the single was certified platinum by the RIAA.A 2018 single, ""All My Friends,"" from their album, Take Good Care, went to No.1 at Adult Alternative radio."
"Ambrosia psilostachya is a species of ragweed known by the common names Cuman ragweed and perennial ragweed, and western ragweed."
"A ninja (忍者, Japanese pronunciation: [ɲiꜜɲdʑa]) or shinobi (忍び, [ɕinobi]) was a covert agent or mercenary in feudal Japan."
"The functions of a ninja included espionage, deception, and surprise attacks."
Their covert methods of waging irregular warfare were deemed dishonorable and beneath the honor of the samurai.
"Though shinobi proper, as specially trained spies and mercenaries, appeared in the 15th century during the Sengoku period, antecedents may have existed as early as the 12th century.In the unrest of the Sengoku period, mercenaries and spies for hire became active in Iga Province and the adjacent area around the village of Kōga, and it is from these areas that much of the knowledge regarding the ninja is drawn."
"Following the unification of Japan under the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, the ninja faded into obscurity."
"A number of shinobi manuals, often based on Chinese military philosophy, were written in the 17th and 18th centuries, most notably the Bansenshūkai (1676).By the time of the Meiji Restoration (1868), shinobi had become a topic of popular imagination and mystery in Japan."
"Ninja figured prominently in legend and folklore, where they were associated with legendary abilities such as invisibility, walking on water and control over natural elements."
"As a consequence, their perception in popular culture is based more on such legends and folklore than on the covert actors of the Sengoku period."
"Plate armour is a historical type of personal body armour made from bronze, iron, or steel plates, culminating in the iconic suit of armour entirely encasing the wearer."
"Full plate steel armour developed in Europe during the Late Middle Ages, especially in the context of the Hundred Years' War, from the coat of plates worn over mail suits during the 14th century."
"In Europe, plate armour reached its peak in the late 15th and early 16th centuries."
"The full suit of armour, also referred to as a panoply, is thus a feature of the very end of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period."
"Its popular association with the ""medieval knight” is due to the specialised jousting armour which developed in the 16th century."
Full suits of Gothic plate armour were worn on the battlefields of the Burgundian and Italian Wars.
"The most heavily armoured troops of the period were heavy cavalry, such as the gendarmes and early cuirassiers, but the infantry troops of the Swiss mercenaries and the Landsknechts also took to wearing lighter suits of ""three quarters"" munition armour, leaving the lower legs unprotected.The use of plate armour declined in the 17th century, but it remained common both among the nobility and for the cuirassiers throughout the European wars of religion."
"After 1650, plate armour was mostly reduced to the simple breastplate (cuirass) worn by cuirassiers."
"This was due to the development of the flintlock musket, which could penetrate armour at a considerable distance."
"For infantry, the breastplate gained renewed importance with the development of shrapnel in the late Napoleonic wars."
"The use of steel plates sewn into flak jackets dates to World War II, replaced by more modern materials such as fibre-reinforced plastic since the 1950s."
"In law, a trial is a coming together of parties to a dispute, to present information (in the form of evidence) in a tribunal, a formal setting with the authority to adjudicate claims or disputes."
One form of tribunal is a court.
"The tribunal, which may occur before a judge, jury, or other designated trier of fact, aims to achieve a resolution to their dispute."
"In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it."
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
A sewing machine is a machine used to sew fabric and  materials together with thread.
Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies.
"Since the invention of the first sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, the sewing machine has greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry."
Home sewing machines are designed for one person to sew individual items while using a single stitch type at a time.
"In a modern sewing machine, the process of stitching has been automated so that the fabric easily glides in and out of the machine without the inconvenience of needles, thimbles and other tools used in hand sewing."
Early sewing machines were powered by either constantly turning a handle or with a foot-operated treadle mechanism.
Electrically-powered machines were later introduced.
"Industrial sewing machines, by contrast to domestic machines, are larger, faster, and more varied in their size, cost, appearance, and task."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
Diplomacy refers to spoken or written speech acts by representatives of states (such as leaders and diplomats) intended to influence events in the international system.Diplomacy is the main instrument of foreign policy and global governance which represents the broader goals and strategies that guide a state's interactions with the rest of the world.
"International treaties, agreements, alliances, and other manifestations of international relations are usually the result of diplomatic negotiations and processes."
Diplomats may also help shape a state by advising government officials.
"Modern diplomatic methods, practices, and principles originated largely from 17th-century European custom."
"Beginning in the early 20th century, diplomacy became professionalized; the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, ratified by most of the world's sovereign states, provides a framework for diplomatic procedures, methods, and conduct."
"Most diplomacy is now conducted by accredited officials, such as envoys and ambassadors, through a dedicated foreign affairs office."
"Diplomats operate through diplomatic missions, most commonly consulates and embassies, and rely on a number of support staff; term diplomat is thus sometimes applied broadly to diplomatic and consular personnel and foreign ministry officials."
A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist).
"Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments."
"In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a ""dress shirt"", a specific type of collared shirt)."
A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar.
Blake is a surname which originated from Old English.
"Its derivation is uncertain; it could come from ""blac"", a nickname for someone who had dark hair or skin, or from ""blaac"", a nickname for someone with pale hair or skin."
"Another theory, presumably in the belief it is a Welsh patronymic in origin, for which there is no evidence, was that it is a corruption of ""Ap Lake"", meaning ""Son of Lake"".Blake was the name of one of the 14 Tribes of Galway in Ireland."
"These Blakes were descendants of Richard Caddell, alias Blake, who was involved in the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169."
"As such a long present foreign name, it became known as de Bláca in Irish.The origins of the name Blake are also considered to be Old Norse, first appearing in Yorkshire, England, possibly derived from the word Blaker, referring to a village and a former municipality of Akershus county, Norway (east of Oslo).Blake often refers to the British poet, painter and printmaker William Blake (1757–1827)."
"In economics, cash ( (listen) kash, or  kaysh in AuE) is money in the physical form of currency, such as banknotes and coins."
"In bookkeeping and financial accounting, cash is current assets comprising currency or currency equivalents that can be accessed immediately or near-immediately (as in the case of money market accounts)."
"Cash is seen either as a reserve for payments, in case of a structural or incidental negative cash flow or as a way to avoid a downturn on financial markets."
"A riddle is a statement, question or phrase having a double or veiled meaning, put forth as a puzzle to be solved."
"Riddles are of two types: enigmas, which are problems generally expressed in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking for their solution, and conundra, which are questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer."
"Archer Taylor says that ""we can probably say that riddling is a universal art"" and cites riddles from hundreds of different cultures including Finnish, Hungarian, American Indian, Chinese, Russian, Dutch and Filipino sources amongst many others."
Many riddles and riddle-themes are internationally widespread.
"In the assessment of Elli Köngas Maranda (originally writing about Malaitian riddles, but with an insight that has been taken up more widely), whereas myths serve to encode and establish social norms, ""riddles make a point of playing with conceptual boundaries and crossing them for the intellectual pleasure of showing that things are not quite as stable as they seem"" — though the point of doing so may still ultimately be to ""play with boundaries, but ultimately to affirm them""."

"The American Eskimo Dog is a breed of companion dog, originating in Germany."
The American Eskimo Dog is a member of the Spitz family.
"The breed's progenitors were German Spitz, but due to anti-German sentiment during the First World War, it was renamed ""American Eskimo Dog."""
"Although modern American Eskimo Dogs have been exported as German Spitz Gross (or Mittel, depending on the dog's height), the breeds have diverged and the standards are significantly different."
"In addition to serving as a watchdog and companion, the American Eskimo Dog also achieved a high degree of popularity in the United States in the 1930s and 1940s as a circus performer."
"There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo Dog breed, the toy, the miniature and the standard."
"They share a common resemblance with Japanese Spitz, Danish Spitz, Volpino Italiano, German Spitz, Indian Spitz, and Samoyeds."
"A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively."
"Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size."
Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.
"In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing."
"Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head."
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"The hippopotamus ( HIP-ə-POT-ə-məs; Hippopotamus amphibius), also called the hippo, common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal and ungulate native to sub-Saharan Africa."
"It is one of only two extant species in the family Hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis or Hexaprotodon liberiensis)."
"The name comes from the ancient Greek for ""river horse"" (ἱπποπόταμος)."
"After the elephant and rhinoceros, the hippopotamus is the third-largest type of land mammal and is the heaviest extant artiodactyl (in the traditional, non-cladistic sense of the term, excluding cetaceans)."
"Despite their physical resemblance to pigs and other terrestrial even-toed ungulates, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc."
"), from which they diverged about 55 million years ago."
"Hippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar legs and large size; adults average 1,500 kg (3,310 lb) for males and 1,300 kg (2,870 lb) for females."
"Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running 30 km/h (19 mph) over short distances."
"Hippos inhabit rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps, where territorial males preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to thirty females and young hippos."
"During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and birth both occur in water."
They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses.
"While hippos rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land."
The hippo is among the most dangerous animals in the world due to its highly aggressive and unpredictable nature.
They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.
"Log rolling, is a sport involving two competitors, each on one end of a free-floating log in a body of water."
"The athletes battle to stay on the log by sprinting, kicking the log, and using a variety of techniques as they attempt to cause the opponent to fall off."
A command-line interface (CLI) processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.
The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor.
Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services.
"Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS."
"Today, many users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions."
"However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line."
"Alternatives to the command line interface include text-based user interface menus (for example, IBM AIX SMIT), keyboard shortcuts, and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer (usually controlled with a mouse)."
"Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, DOS Shell, and Mouse Systems PowerPanel."
Command-line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text-based user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.
Programs with command-line interfaces are generally easier to automate via scripting.
Many software systems implement command-line interfaces for control and operation.
This includes programming environments and utility programs.
"In music, harmony is the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing."
"Usually, this means simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords.Harmony is a perceptual property of music, and, along with melody, one of the building blocks of Western music."
"Its perception is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times throughout Western music."
"In a physiological approach, consonance is a continuous variable."
"Consonant pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough.The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them.Harmony is often said to refer to the ""vertical"" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the ""horizontal"" aspect.Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are therefore sometimes distinguished from harmony.In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities."
"In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with ""tensions""."
A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass.
"Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) ""resolves"" to a consonant chord."
Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds.
"In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between ""tense"" and ""relaxed"" moments."
"Comparison or comparing is the act of evaluating two or more things by determining the relevant, comparable characteristics of each thing, and then determining which characteristics of each are similar to the other, which are different, and to what degree."
"Where characteristics are different, the differences may then be evaluated to determine which thing is best suited for a particular purpose."
The description of similarities and differences found between the two things is also called a comparison.
"Comparison can take many distinct forms, varying by field:

To compare is to bring two or more things together (physically or in contemplation) and to examine them systematically, identifying similarities and differences among them."
Comparison has a different meaning within each framework of study.
Any exploration of the similarities or differences of two or more units is a comparison.
"In the most limited sense, it consists of comparing two units isolated from each other."
"To compare things, they must have characteristics that are similar enough in relevant ways to merit comparison."
"If two things are too different to compare in a useful way, an attempt to compare them is colloquially referred to in English as ""comparing apples and oranges."""
"Comparison is widely used in society, in science and in the arts."
"A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes."
"Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive."
"Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping."
"The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables."
"Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times."
"The word ""map"" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world."
"Thus, ""map"" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world."
"Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts, such as taxes, in a particular country or socio-economic context."
"The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value and sometimes, a standard of deferred payment."
Any item or verifiable record that fulfils these functions can be considered as money.
"Money is historically an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems are based on fiat money."
"Fiat money, like any check or note of debt, is without use value as a physical commodity."
"It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender; that is, it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for ""all debts, public and private""."
Counterfeit money can cause good money to lose its value.
"The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts)."
"Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries."
"A cup is an open-top container used to hold or cold liquids for pouring or drinking; while mainly used for drinking, it also can be used to store solids for pouring (e.g., sugar, flour, grains, salt)."
"Cups may be made of glass, metal, china, clay, wood, stone, polystyrene, plastic, aluminium or other materials, and are usually fixed with a stem, handles, or other adornments."
"Cups are used for quenching thirst across a wide range of cultures and social classes, and different styles of cups may be used for different liquids or in different situations."
Cups of different styles may be used for different types of liquids or other foodstuffs (e.g.
"teacups and measuring cups), in different situations (e.g."
"at water stations or in ceremonies and rituals),or for decoration."
"Mantises are an order (Mantodea) of insects that contains over 2,400 species in about 460 genera in 33 families."
"The largest family is the Mantidae (""mantids"")."
Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats.
They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks.
"Their elongated bodies may or may not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis."
"The closest relatives of mantises are termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), which are all within the superorder Dictyoptera."
"Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other unrelated insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae)."
"Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey."
They normally live for about a year.
"In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die."
The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring.
"Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation."
"Mantises were considered to have supernatural powers by early civilizations, including Ancient Greece, Ancient Egypt, and Assyria."
A cultural trope popular in cartoons imagines the female mantis as a femme fatale.
Mantises are among the insects most commonly kept as pets.
Blacklist (Thai: Blacklist – นักเรียนลับ บัญชีดำ; Blacklist – Nakrian Lap Banchi Dam; lit.
"Secret Student Blacklist) is a 2019 Thai television series starring Korapat Kirdpan (Nanon), Wachirawit Ruangwiwat (Chimon), Pawat Chittsawangdee (Ohm), Sattabut Laedeke (Drake), Kanaphan Puitrakul (First), Thanatsaran Samthonglai (Frank) and Preeti Barameeanant (Bank)."
"Directed by Worrawech Danuwong and produced by GMMTV together with Lasercat Studio, the series was one of the thirteen television series for 2019 launched by GMMTV in their ""Wonder Th13teen"" event on 5 November 2018."
"It premiered on GMM 25 and LINE TV on 13 October 2019, airing on Sundays at 21:25 ICT and 23:00 ICT, respectively."
The series concluded on 29 December 2019.
"A throne is the seat of state of a potentate or dignitary, especially the seat occupied by a sovereign on state occasions; or the seat occupied by a pope or bishop on ceremonial occasions."
"""Throne"" in an abstract sense can also refer to the monarchy or the Crown itself, an instance of metonymy, and is also used in many expressions such as ""the power behind the throne""."
"The expression ""ascend (mount) the throne"" takes its meaning from the steps leading up to the dais or platform, on which the throne is placed, being formerly comprised in the word's significance.When used in a political or governmental sense, throne typically refers to a civilization, nation, tribe, or other politically designated group that is organized or governed under an authoritarian system."
"Throughout much of human history societies have been governed under authoritarian systems, in particular dictatorial or autocratic systems, resulting in a wide variety of thrones that have been used by given heads of state."
"These have ranged from stools in places such as in Africa to ornate chairs and bench-like designs in Europe and Asia, respectively."
"Often, but not always, a throne is tied to a philosophical or religious ideology held by the nation or people in question, which serves a dual role in unifying the people under the reigning monarch and connecting the monarch upon the throne to his or her predecessors, who sat upon the throne previously."
"Accordingly, many thrones are typically held to have been constructed or fabricated out of rare or hard to find materials that may be valuable or important to the land in question."
"Depending on the size of the throne in question it may be large and ornately designed as an emplaced instrument of a nation's power, or it may be a symbolic chair with little or no precious materials incorporated into the design."
"When used in a religious sense, throne can refer to one of two distinct uses."
"The first use derives from the practice in churches of having a bishop or higher-ranking religious official (archbishop, Pope, etc.)"
"sit on a special chair which in church referred to by written sources as a ""throne"", or “Cathedra” (Latin for chair) and is intended to allow such high-ranking religious officials a place to sit in their place of worship."
The other use for throne refers to a belief among many of the world's monotheistic and polytheistic religions that the deity or deities that they worship are seated on a throne.
"Such beliefs go back to ancient times, and can be seen in surviving artwork and texts which discuss the idea of ancient gods (such as the Twelve Olympians) seated on thrones."
"In the major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Throne of God is attested to in religious scriptures and teachings, although the origin, nature, and idea of the Throne of God in these religions differs according to the given religious ideology practiced."
"In the west, a throne is most identified as the seat upon which a person holding the title King, Queen, Emperor, or Empress sits in a nation using a monarchy political system, although there are a few exceptions, notably with regards to religious officials such as the Pope and bishops of various sects of the Christian faith."
"Changing geo-political tides have resulted in the collapse of several dictatorial and autocratic governments, which in turn have left a number of throne chairs empty."
Many of these thrones - such as China's Dragon Throne - survive today as historic examples of nation's previous government.
A calendar is a system of organizing days.
"This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years."
"A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system."
A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system.
"A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills."
"Periods in a calendar (such as years and months) are usually, though not necessarily, synchronized with the cycle of the sun or the moon."
"The most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar, a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain synchronized with the solar year over the long term."
"A finger is a limb of the body and a type of digit, an organ of manipulation and sensation found in the hands of most of the Tetrapods, so also with humans and other primates."
Most land vertebrates have five fingers (Pentadactyly).
A boy is a young male human.
The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent.
"When a male human reaches adulthood, he is described as a man."
"In a deck of playing cards, the term face card (US) or court card (British and US), and sometimes Royalty, is generally used to describe a card that depicts a person as opposed to the pip cards."
"They are also known as picture cards, or until the early 20th century, coat cards."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"General knowledge is information that has been accumulated over time through various mediums, sources."
It excludes specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium.
General knowledge is an essential component of crystallized intelligence.
It is strongly associated with general intelligence and with openness to experience.Studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many.
General knowledge is thought to be supported by long-term semantic memory ability.
General knowledge also supports schemata for textual understanding.
"In 2019, it was found in a survey that New Zealanders had ""concerning"" gaps in their general knowledge."
"In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is an object similar to a line, but that does not have to be straight."
"Intuitively, a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point."
"This is the definition that appeared more than 2000 years ago in Euclid's Elements: ""The [curved] line is […] the first species of quantity, which has only one dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which […] will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length, exempt of any width."
"""This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as: A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function."
"In some contexts, the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization, and the curve is a parametric curve."
"In this article, these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves."
"This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics; notable exceptions are level curves (which are unions of curves and isolated points), and algebraic curves (see below)."
"Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves, since they are generally defined by implicit equations."
"Nevertheless, the class of topological curves is very broad, and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve, or even cannot be drawn."
This is the case of space-filling curves and fractal curves.
"For ensuring more regularity, the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable, and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve."
A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates.
"More generally, an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials, which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one."
"If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k, the curve is said to be defined over k. In the common case of a real algebraic curve, where k is the field of real numbers, an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves."
"When complex zeros are considered, one has a complex algebraic curve, which, from the topological point of view, is not a curve, but a surface, and is often called a Riemann surface."
"Although not being curves in the common sense, algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied."
"In particular, algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography."
"The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit."
"The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness."
"It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates."
"Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products such as candy, soap, lip gloss, perfume, and many others."
"The garden strawberry was first bred in Brittany, France, in the 1750s via a cross of Fragaria virginiana from eastern North America and Fragaria chiloensis, which was brought from Chile by Amédée-François Frézier in 1714."
"Cultivars of Fragaria × ananassa have replaced, in commercial production, the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca), which was the first strawberry species cultivated in the early 17th century.The strawberry is not, from a botanical point of view, a berry."
"Technically, it is an aggregate accessory fruit, meaning that the fleshy part is derived not from the plant's ovaries but from the receptacle that holds the ovaries."
"Each apparent ""seed"" (achene) on the outside of the fruit is actually one of the ovaries of the flower, with a seed inside it.In 2019, world production of strawberries was 9 million tonnes, led by China with 40% of the total."
"Chief constable is the rank used by the chief police officer of every territorial police force in the United Kingdom except for the City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police, as well as the chief officers of the three 'special' national police forces, the British Transport Police, Ministry of Defence Police, and Civil Nuclear Constabulary."
"The title is also held by the chief officers of the principal Crown Dependency police forces, the Isle of Man Constabulary, States of Guernsey Police Service, and States of Jersey Police."
"The title was also held, ex officio, by the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers under the Police Reform Act 2002."
It was also the title of the chief officer of the Royal Parks Constabulary until this agency was disbanded in 2004.
Throughout the United Kingdom and Crown Dependencies there are currently fifty chief constables.
"These consist of the chief officers of 37 English territorial forces outside London, four Welsh territorial forces, the Police Service of Scotland, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, three special national forces and three Crown Dependency constabularies."
The chief officers of some police departments in Canada also hold the title of chief constable.
The chief officer of the Sovereign Base Areas Police also holds the title of chief constable.
"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool."
"Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements."
"However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)."
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well."
"They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals."
"The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship."
"On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play."
"Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player."
A toy and a game are not the same.
Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction."
"Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both."
"Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role."
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures."
"The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games."
"Punishment, commonly, is the imposition of an undesirable or unpleasant outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an authority—in contexts ranging from child discipline to criminal law—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or behavior that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable."
"It is, however, possible to distinguish between various different understandings of what punishment is.The reasoning for punishment may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social conformity (in particular, in the contexts of compulsory education or military discipline), to defend norms, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from violent crime), and to maintain the law—and respect for rule of law—under which the social group is governed."
"Punishment may be self-inflicted as with self-flagellation and mortification of the flesh in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social coercion."
"The unpleasant imposition may include a fine, penalty, or confinement, or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable."
"The individual may be a person, or even an animal."
"The authority may be either a group or a single person, and punishment may be carried out formally under a system of law or informally in other kinds of social settings such as within a family."
Negative consequences that are not authorized or that are administered without a breach of rules are not considered to be punishment as defined here.
"The study and practice of the punishment of crimes, particularly as it applies to imprisonment, is called penology, or, often in modern texts, corrections; in this context, the punishment process is euphemistically called ""correctional process""."
Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.
"Justifications for punishment include retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and incapacitation."
"The last could include such measures as isolation, in order to prevent the wrongdoer's having contact with potential victims, or the removal of a hand in order to make theft more difficult.If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than ""punishment"" may be considered more accurate."
"Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered revenge or spite rather than punishment."
"In addition, the word ""punishment"" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences ""punishment"" during a fight."
"In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment."
"Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include sanctions such as reprimands, deprivations of privileges or liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the infliction of pain, amputation and the death penalty."
Corporal punishment refers to punishments in which physical pain is intended to be inflicted upon the transgressor.
Punishments may be judged as fair or unfair in terms of their degree of reciprocity and proportionality to the offense.
"Punishment can be an integral part of socialization, and punishing unwanted behavior is often part of a system of pedagogy or behavioral modification which also includes rewards."
"Clothing (also known as clothes, apparel, and attire) are items worn on the body."
"Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together."
The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies.
"The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations."
"Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the head."
"Eyewear and jewelry are not generally considered items of clothing, but play an important role in fashion and clothing as costume."
"Other wearables are not always considered to be clothing despite belonging to an accepted class, such as orthodontic headgear, which is a medical appliance."
"The human body is not always complete, and sometimes includes prosthetic devices, such as a limb prosthesis, which might be adorned similarly to an intact body, differently, or not at all."
Some styles of prosthetic legs are designed to require ordinary street shoes to function properly.
"Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones, rash-causing plants, insect bites, splinters, thorns and prickles by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment."
"Clothing can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body."
It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation in varied environments.
Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation.
"It  may used to prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats."
"Clothing is used for protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare."
"Fashioned with pockets, belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands."
Clothing has significant social factors as well.
Wearing clothes is a variable social norm.
It may connote modesty.
Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing.
"In many parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breasts, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent exposure."
"Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs."
"Clothing also may be used to communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism."
"Some forms of personal protective equipment amount to clothing, such as coveralls, chaps or a doctor's white coat, with similar requirements for maintenance and cleaning as other textiles (boxing gloves function both as protective equipment and as a sparring weapon, so the equipment aspect rises above the glove aspect)."
"More specialized forms of protective equipment, such as face shields are classified protective accessories."
"At the far extreme, self-enclosing diving suits or space suits are form fitting body covers, and amount to a form of dress, without being clothing per se, while containing enough high technology to amount to more of a tool than a garment."
This line will continue to blur as wearable technology embeds assistive devices directly into the fabric itself; the enabling innovations are ultra low power consumption and flexible electronic substrates.
"Clothing also hybridizes into a personal transportation system (ice skates, roller skates, cargo pants, other outdoor survival gear, one-man band) or concealment system (stage magicians, hidden linings or pockets in tradecraft, integrated holsters for concealed carry, merchandise-laden trench coats on the black market — where the purpose of the clothing often carries over into disguise)."
"A mode of dress fit to purpose, whether stylistic or functional, is known as an outfit or ensemble."
"A rifle is a long-barrelled firearm designed for accurate shooting, with a barrel that has a helical pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall."
"In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter's shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting."
"Rifles are used extensively in warfare, self defense, law enforcement, crime (most notably assassinations), hunting, and shooting sports."
"The term was originally rifled gun, with the verb rifle referring to the early modern machining process of creating groovings with cutting tools."
"By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun rifle is now often used for any long-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger (e.g., personnel halting and stimulation response rifle, which is actually a laser dazzler)."
"Like all typical firearms, a rifle's projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder, later cordite, and now nitrocellulose), although other propulsive means such as compressed air are used in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (plinking)."
"The distinct feature that separates a rifle from the earlier smoothbore long guns (e.g., arquebuses, muskets) is the rifling within its gun barrel."
"The raised areas of a barrel's rifling are called lands, which make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin around its longitudinal axis."
"When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, preventing yawing and tumbling in flight."
This allows the use of more elongated and aerodynamically efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in smoothbore muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy.
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
"A sister is a woman or girl who shares one or more parents with another individual, a sibling."
The male counterpart is a brother.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full sister is a first degree relative.
A stream is a body of water with surface water flowing within the bed and banks of a channel.
"The flow of a stream is controlled by three inputs – surface water, subsurface water and groundwater."
The surface and subsurface water are highly variable between periods of rainfall.
"Groundwater, on the other hand, has a relatively constant input and is controlled more by long-term patterns of precipitation."
"The stream encompasses surface, subsurface and groundwater fluxes that respond to geological, geomorphological, hydrological and biotic controls.Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to by a variety of local or regional names."
Long large streams are usually called rivers.
"Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and corridors for fish and wildlife migration."
The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.
"Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity."
The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface hydrology and is a core element of environmental geography.
"Glitter is an assortment of small, reflective particles that come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors."
"Glitter particles reflect light at different angles, causing the surface to sparkle or shimmer."
"Glitter is similar to confetti, sparkles and sequins, but somewhat smaller."
"Since prehistoric times, glitter has been made from many different materials including stones such as malachite, and mica, as well as insects and glass."
Modern glitter is usually manufactured from the combination of aluminum and plastic which is rarely recycled leading some scientists to call for bans on plastic glitter.
"Laundry refers to the washing of clothing and other textiles, and, more broadly, their drying and ironing as well."
"Laundry has been part of history since humans began to wear clothes, so the methods by which different cultures have dealt with this universal human need are of interest to several branches of scholarship."
"Laundry work has traditionally been highly gendered, with the responsibility in most cultures falling to women (formerly known as laundresses or washerwomen)."
"The Industrial Revolution gradually led to mechanized solutions to laundry work, notably the washing machine and later the tumble dryer."
"Laundry, like cooking and child care, is still done both at home and by commercial establishments outside the home.The word ""laundry"" may refer to the clothing itself, or to the place where the cleaning happens."
An individual home may have a laundry room; a utility room includes but is not restricted to the function of washing clothes.
An apartment building or student hall of residence may have a shared laundry facility such as a tvättstuga.
A stand-alone business is referred to as a self-service laundry (launderette in British English or laundromat in North American English).
"A mountain is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock."
"A mountain differs from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is larger than a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1000 feet) above the surrounding land."
"A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in mountain ranges.Mountains are formed through tectonic forces, erosion, or volcanism, which act on time scales of up to tens of millions of years."
"Once mountain building ceases, mountains are slowly leveled through the action of weathering, through slumping and other forms of mass wasting, as well as through erosion by rivers and glaciers."
High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level at similar latitude.
These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals.
"Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction, such as mining and logging, along with recreation, such as mountain climbing and skiing."
"The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,850 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level."
"The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft)."
"Radar (radio detection and ranging) is a detection system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (ranging), angle, or velocity of objects."
"It can be used to detect aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain."
"A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the object(s)."
"Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information about the object's location and speed."
Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II.
"A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution."
"The term RADAR was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for ""radio detection and ranging""."
"The term radar has since entered English and other languages as a common noun, losing all capitalization."
"During RAF RADAR courses in 1954/5 at Yatesbury Training Camp ""radio azimuth direction and ranging"" was suggested."
"The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, antimissile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations."
"High tech radar systems are associated with digital signal processing, machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels."
Other systems similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.
"One example is LIDAR, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves."
"With the emergence of driverless vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents."
The following is a list of Scottish clans with and without chiefs.
The crest badges used by members of Scottish clans are based upon armorial bearings recorded by the Lord Lyon King of Arms in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland.
"The blazon of the heraldic crest is given, and the heraldic motto with its translation into English."
"While all the crest badges of the clan names listed are recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, only about one half of these (about 140) have a clan chief who is acknowledged by the Lord Lyon King of Arms as the rightful claimant of the undifferenced arms upon which the crest badges are based."
Scottish crest badges are heraldic badges used by members of Scottish clans to show their allegiance to a specific clan or clan chief.
"Even though they are commonly used by clan members, the heraldic crest and motto within the crest badge belong only to the clan chief – never the clan member."
"A Scottish clan member's crest badge is made up of a heraldic crest, encircled by a strap and buckle which contains a heraldic motto."
"In most cases, both crest and motto are derived from the crest and motto of the chief's coat of arms."
Crest badges intended for wear as cap badges are commonly made of silver or some other metal such as pewter.
"In the case of armigers they wear their own crest within a plain circlet showing their own motto or slogan, not a belt and buckle showing the chief's."
Women may wear a crest badge as a brooch to pin a sash of their clan tartan at the right shoulder of their gown or blouse.
"Female clan chiefs, chieftains, or the wives of clan chiefs normally wear a tartan sash pinned at their left shoulder."
"Today, Scottish crest badges are commonly used by members of Scottish clans."
"However, much like clan tartans, Scottish crest badges do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, and the dress of the Highland Regiments."
Scottish crest badges have only been worn by clan members on the bonnet since the 19th century.
Anacondas or water boas are a group of large snakes of the genus Eunectes.
They are found in tropical South America.
Four species are currently recognized.
"A tooth (plural teeth) is a hard, calcified structure found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates and used to break down food."
"Some animals, particularly carnivores and omnivores, also use teeth to help with capturing or wounding prey, tearing food, for defensive purposes, to intimidate other animals often including their own, or to carry prey or their young."
The roots of teeth are covered by gums.
"Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness that originate from the embryonic germ layer, the ectoderm."
"The general structure of teeth is similar across the vertebrates, although there is considerable variation in their form and position."
"The teeth of mammals have deep roots, and this pattern is also found in some fish, and in crocodilians."
"In most teleost fish, however, the teeth are attached to the outer surface of the bone, while in lizards they are attached to the inner surface of the jaw by one side."
"In cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, the teeth are attached by tough ligaments to the hoops of cartilage that form the jaw.Some animals develop only one set of teeth (monophyodonts) while others are diphyodonts, i.e."
"they have an early set of deciduous teeth and a later set of permanent or ""adult"" teeth."
Still others develop many sets (polyphyodonts).
"Sharks, for example, grow a new set of teeth every two weeks to replace worn teeth."
"Most extant mammals including humans are diphyodonts, but there are exceptions including elephants, kangaroos, and manatees, all of which are polyphyodonts."
"Rodent incisors grow and wear away continually through gnawing, which helps maintain relatively constant length."
The industry of the beaver is due in part to this qualification.
"Many rodents such as voles and guinea pigs, but not mice, as well as leporidae like rabbits, have continuously growing molars in addition to incisors."
"Also, tusks (in tusked mammals) grow almost throughout life.Teeth are not always attached to the jaw, as they are in mammals."
"In many reptiles and fish, teeth are attached to the palate or to the floor of the mouth, forming additional rows inside those on the jaws proper."
Some teleosts even have teeth in the pharynx.
"While not true teeth in the usual sense, the dermal denticles of sharks are almost identical in structure and are likely to have the same evolutionary origin."
"Indeed, teeth appear to have first evolved in sharks, and are not found in the more primitive jawless fish – while lampreys do have tooth-like structures on the tongue, these are in fact, composed of keratin, not of dentine or enamel, and bear no relationship to true teeth."
"Though ""modern"" teeth-like structures with dentine and enamel have been found in late conodonts, they are now supposed to have evolved independently of later vertebrates' teeth.Living amphibians typically have small teeth, or none at all, since they commonly feed only on soft foods."
"In reptiles, teeth are generally simple and conical in shape, although there is some variation between species, most notably the venom-injecting fangs of snakes."
"The pattern of incisors, canines, premolars and molars is found only in mammals, and to varying extents, in their evolutionary ancestors."
The numbers of these types of teeth vary greatly between species; zoologists use a standardised dental formula to describe the precise pattern in any given group.
"An organization, or organisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is an entity—such as a company, an institution, or an association—comprising one or more people and having a particular purpose."
"The word is derived from the Greek word organon, which means tool or instrument, musical instrument, and organ."
Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
"Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria)."
"By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for ""green plants""), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae."
Most plants are multicellular organisms.
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.
"Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color."
"Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds."
"Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common."
"There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds."
"Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems."
"Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia."
"Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs."
"The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology."
"In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference."
"Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs, particularly in their conjugation patterns."
"The main tenses found in many languages include the past, present, and future."
"Some languages have only two distinct tenses, such as past and nonpast, or future and nonfuture."
"There are also tenseless languages, like most of the Chinese languages, though they can possess a future and nonfuture system typical of Sino-Tibetan languages."
In recent work Maria Bittner and Judith Tonhauser have described the different ways in which tenseless languages nonetheless mark time.
"On the other hand, some languages make finer tense distinctions, such as remote vs recent past, or near vs remote future."
Tenses generally express time relative to the moment of speaking.
"In some contexts, however, their meaning may be relativized to a point in the past or future which is established in the discourse (the moment being spoken about)."
This is called relative (as opposed to absolute) tense.
"Some languages have different verb forms or constructions which manifest relative tense, such as pluperfect (""past-in-the-past"") and ""future-in-the-past""."
Expressions of tense are often closely connected with expressions of the category of aspect; sometimes what are traditionally called tenses (in languages such as Latin) may in modern analysis be regarded as combinations of tense with aspect.
"Verbs are also often conjugated for mood, and since in many cases the three categories are not manifested separately, some languages may be described in terms of a combined tense–aspect–mood (TAM) system."
"A shore or a shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake."
"In physical oceanography, a shore is the wider fringe that is geologically modified by the action of the body of water past and present, while the beach is at the edge of the shore, representing the intertidal zone where there is one."
"In contrast to a coast, a shore can border any body of water, while the coast must border an ocean or a sea."
"Therefore, in that sense, a coast is a type of shore."
"However, the word ""coast"" often refers to an area far wider than the shore, often stretching miles into the interior."
"Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by water induced erosion, such as waves."
The geological composition of rock and soil dictates the type of shore which is created.
Claytonia perfoliata (syn.
"Montia perfoliata), also known as miner's lettuce, Indian lettuce, spring beauty, winter purslane, or palsingat, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae."
"It is a fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America, from southernmost Alaska and central British Columbia, all the way south to Central America, but most common in California in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin Valleys."
"Together with Claytonia parviflora and C. rubra, C. perfoliata comprises what is almost certainly a polyploid pillar complex, which is based on three diploid species."
Two key studies on the population ecology and genetics of the C. perfoliata complex were published in 2012.
The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of a typical tetrapod.
"It manipulates food for mastication and swallowing as part of the digestive process, and is the primary organ of taste."
The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered by taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae.
It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels.
The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth.
A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals.
"The human tongue is divided into two parts, an oral part at the front and a pharyngeal part at the back."
"The left and right sides are also separated along most of its length by a vertical section of fibrous tissue (the lingual septum) that results in a groove, the median sulcus, on the tongue's surface."
There are two groups of muscles of the tongue.
The four intrinsic muscles alter the shape of the tongue and are not attached to bone.
The four paired extrinsic muscles change the position of the tongue and are anchored to bone.
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
"Lasagne (US: , also UK: , Italian: [laˈzaɲɲe]; singular lasagna, Italian: [laˈzaɲɲa]) are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets."
"Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil."
"The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking."
Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven.
The resulting casserole is cut into single-serving square portions.
A kitchen is a room or part of a room used for cooking and food preparation in a dwelling or in a commercial establishment.
"A modern middle-class residential kitchen is typically equipped with a stove, a sink with hot and cold running water, a refrigerator, and worktops and kitchen cabinets arranged according to a modular design."
"Many households have a microwave oven, a dishwasher, and other electric appliances."
"The main functions of a kitchen are to store, prepare and cook food (and to complete related tasks such as dishwashing)."
"The room or area may also be used for dining (or small meals such as breakfast), entertaining and laundry."
The design and construction of kitchens is a huge market all over the world.
"Commercial kitchens are found in restaurants, cafeterias, hotels, hospitals, educational and workplace facilities, army barracks, and similar establishments."
These kitchens are generally larger and equipped with bigger and more heavy-duty equipment than a residential kitchen.
"For example, a large restaurant may have a huge walk-in refrigerator and a large commercial dishwasher machine."
"In some instances, commercial kitchen equipment such as commercial sinks is used in household settings as it offers ease of use for food preparation and high durability.In developed countries, commercial kitchens are generally subject to public health laws."
"They are inspected periodically by public-health officials, and forced to close if they do not meet hygienic requirements mandated by law."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"Quantum Leap is an American science-fiction television series, created by Donald P. Bellisario, that originally aired on NBC for five seasons, from March 25, 1989 through May 5, 1993."
"It stars Scott Bakula as Dr. Sam Beckett, a physicist who involuntarily leaps through spacetime during experiments in time travel, by temporarily taking the place of other people to correct what he consistently discovers were historical mistakes."
"Dean Stockwell co-stars as Admiral Al Calavicci, Sam's womanizing, cigar-smoking companion and best friend, who appears to him as a hologram and researches and shapes his opinions of the past."
"The series features a mix of humor, drama, romance, social commentary, and science fiction."
"It was ranked number 19 on TV Guide's ""Top Cult Shows Ever"" in 2007."
"Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of  Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc."
"), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven."
A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
"In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork."
"In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand."
"The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania."
"Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries."
"It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),  restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food."
"Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven."
"In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias."
"Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.The Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana (lit."
True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza.
"In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage."
"Sombre is a 1998 French film directed by Philippe Grandrieux, starring Marc Barbé and Elina Löwensohn."
The film was nominated for the Golden Leopard and won the C.I.C.A.E.
Award - Special Mention at the Locarno International Film Festival.
"Tissue paper or simply tissue is a lightweight paper or, light crêpe paper."
Tissue can be made from recycled paper pulp.
"Cornbread is a quick bread made with cornmeal, associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States, with origins in Native American cuisine."
It is an example of batter bread.
Dumplings and pancakes made with finely ground cornmeal were staple foods of the Hopi people in Arizona.
The Hidatsa people of the Upper Midwest called baked cornbread naktsi.
"Cherokee and Seneca tribes enriched the basic batter, adding chestnuts, sunflower seeds, apples or berries, and sometimes combining beans or potatoes with the cornmeal."
Modern versions of cornbread are usually leavened by baking powder.
"A yoke is a wooden beam normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to pull together on a load when working in pairs, as oxen usually do; some yokes are fitted to individual animals."
"There are several types of yoke, used in different cultures, and for different types of oxen."
"A pair of oxen may be called a yoke of oxen, and yoke is also a verb, as in ""to yoke a pair of oxen""."
"Other animals that may be yoked include horses, mules, donkeys, and water buffalo."
ToeJam & Earl is an action game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) console.
"Released in 1991, it centers on ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth."
"As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft."
It references and parodies 1980s and early 90s urban culture and is set to a funk soundtrack.
"ToeJam & Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue (1980) and derived various features from the game, such as the random generation of levels and items."
"As such, ToeJam & Earl is often considered to be an example of a roguelike game.The game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode."
"It attained sleeper hit status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega."
"ToeJam & Earl was followed by two sequels: ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl III: Mission to Earth, released for the Sega Genesis and Xbox respectively."
The sequels' commercial and critical success were mixed.
"A fourth title without Sega's involvement, ToeJam & Earl: Back in the Groove, was released on March 1, 2019 with funds from Kickstarter."
The game was re-released for the Wii's Virtual Console in December 2006 and re-released again on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in November 2012 as part of the Sega Vintage Collection.
"This game was also released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service on December 16, 2021."
A passenger (also abbreviated as pax) is a person who travels in a vehicle but bears little or no responsibility for the tasks required for that vehicle to arrive at its destination or otherwise operate the vehicle.
"The vehicles may be bicycles, buses, passenger trains, airliners, ships, ferryboats, and other methods of transportation."
"Crew members (if any), as well as the driver or pilot of the vehicle, are usually not considered to be passengers."
"For example, a flight attendant on an airline would not be considered a passenger while on duty and the same with those working in the kitchen or restaurant on board a ship as well as cleaning staff, but an employee riding in a company car being driven by another person would be considered a passenger, even if the car was being driven on company business."
"Beetles are insects that form the order Coleoptera (), in the superorder Endopterygota."
"Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects."
"The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 described species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently, with estimates suggesting that there are between 0.9 to 2.1 million total species."
"Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the polar regions, they interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates."
"Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops."
"Beetles typically have a particularly hard exoskeleton including the elytra, though some such as the rove beetles have very short elytra while blister beetles have softer elytra."
"The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in water beetles which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving."
"Beetles are endopterygotes, which means that they undergo complete metamorphosis, with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile pupal stage."
"Some, such as stag beetles, have a marked sexual dimorphism, the males possessing enormously enlarged mandibles which they use to fight other males."
"Many beetles are aposematic, with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless Batesian mimics of such insects."
"Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective camouflage."
"Beetles are prominent in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling."
Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays.
"Over 300 species are used as food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae."
"However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests."
"Serious pests include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle."
"Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests."
"Boiling is the rapid vaporization of a liquid, which occurs when a liquid is heated to its boiling point, the temperature at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to the pressure exerted on the liquid by the surrounding atmosphere."
"There are two main types of boiling: nucleate boiling where small bubbles of vapour form at discrete points, and critical heat flux boiling where the boiling surface is heated above a certain critical temperature and a film of vapor forms on the surface."
"Transition boiling is an intermediate, unstable form of boiling with elements of both types."
The boiling point of water is 100 °C or 212 °F but is lower with the decreased atmospheric pressure found at higher altitudes.
Boiling water is used as a method of making it potable by killing microbes and viruses that may be present.
"The sensitivity of different micro-organisms to heat varies, but if water is held at 100 °C (212 °F) for one minute, most micro-organisms and viruses are inactivated."
Ten minutes at a temperature of 70 °C (158 °F) is also sufficient for most bacteria.
"Boiling water is also used in several cooking methods including boiling, steaming, and poaching."
Opera  is a form of theatre in which music is a fundamental component and dramatic roles are taken by singers.
"Such a ""work"" (the literal translation of the Italian word ""opera"") is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet."
"The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor."
"Although musical theatre is closely related to opera, the two are considered to be distinct from one another.Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition."
"Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theatre, Singspiel and Opéra comique."
"In traditional number opera, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias."
The 19th century saw the rise of the continuous music drama.
"Opera originated in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with Jacopo Peri's mostly lost Dafne, produced in Florence in 1598) especially from works by Claudio Monteverdi, notably L'Orfeo, and soon spread through the rest of Europe: Heinrich Schütz in Germany, Jean-Baptiste Lully in France, and Henry Purcell in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century."
"In the 18th century, Italian opera continued to dominate most of Europe (except France), attracting foreign composers such as George Frideric Handel."
"Opera seria was the most prestigious form of Italian opera, until Christoph Willibald Gluck reacted against its artificiality with his ""reform"" operas in the 1760s."
"The most renowned figure of late 18th-century opera is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who began with opera seria but is most famous for his Italian comic operas, especially The Marriage of Figaro (Le nozze di Figaro), Don Giovanni, and Così fan tutte, as well as Die Entführung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio), and The Magic Flute (Die Zauberflöte), landmarks in the German tradition."
"The first third of the 19th century saw the high point of the bel canto style, with Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti and Vincenzo Bellini all creating signature works of that style."
It also saw the advent of grand opera typified by the works of Daniel Auber and Giacomo Meyerbeer as well as Carl Maria von Weber's introduction of German Romantische Oper (German Romantic Opera).
"The mid-to-late 19th century was a golden age of opera, led and dominated by Giuseppe Verdi in Italy and Richard Wagner in Germany."
The popularity of opera continued through the verismo era in Italy and contemporary French opera through to Giacomo Puccini and Richard Strauss in the early 20th century.
"During the 19th century, parallel operatic traditions emerged in central and eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and Bohemia."
"The 20th century saw many experiments with modern styles, such as atonality and serialism (Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg), neoclassicism (Igor Stravinsky), and minimalism (Philip Glass and John Adams)."
"With the rise of recording technology, singers such as Enrico Caruso and Maria Callas became known to much wider audiences that went beyond the circle of opera fans."
"Since the invention of radio and television, operas were also performed on (and written for) these media."
"Beginning in 2006, a number of major opera houses began to present live high-definition video transmissions of their performances in cinemas all over the world."
"Since 2009, complete performances can be downloaded and are live streamed."
"A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity."
"A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it."
"The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see The Crown)."
A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules.
"Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of ""his"" federal government."
"SEAT S.A. (English: , Spanish: [ˈseat]; Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo) is a Spanish car manufacturer, which sells its vehicles under the SEAT and Cupra brands."
"It was founded on 9 May 1950, by the Instituto Nacional de Industria (INI), a Spanish state-owned industrial holding company."
It quickly became the largest supplier of cars in Spain.
"In 1986, after 36 years being publicly listed as an independent automaker, the Spanish government sold SEAT to the Volkswagen Group of which it remains a wholly owned subsidiary.The headquarters of SEAT S.A. are located at the company's industrial complex in Martorell near Barcelona."
"In 2020, annual production was over 468,000 units, with more than 427,000 cars sold in just one year, exported to over 75 countries worldwide."
"A sink – also known by other names including sinker, washbowl, hand basin, wash basin, and simply basin – is a bowl-shaped plumbing fixture used for washing hands, dishwashing, and other purposes."
Sinks have taps (faucets) that supply hot and cold water and may include a spray feature to be used for faster rinsing.
They also include a drain to remove used water; this drain may itself include a strainer and/or shut-off device and an overflow-prevention device.
Sinks may also have an integrated soap dispenser.
"Many sinks, especially in kitchens, are installed adjacent to or inside a counter."
"When a sink becomes clogged, a person will often resort to using a chemical drain cleaner or a plunger, though most professional plumbers will remove the clog with a drain auger (often called a ""plumber's snake"")."
A committee or commission is a body of one or more persons subordinate to an assembly.
A committee is not itself considered to be a form of assembly.
"Usually, the assembly sends matters into a committee as a way to explore them more fully than would be possible if the assembly itself were considering them."
Committees may have different functions and their types of work differ depending on the type of the organization and its needs.
"A member of a legislature may be delegated a committee assignment, which gives them the right to serve on a certain committee."
"Credit (from Latin credit, ""(he/she/it) believes"") is the trust which allows one party to provide money or resources to another party wherein the second party does not reimburse the first party immediately (thereby generating a debt), but promises either to repay or return those resources (or other materials of equal value) at a later date."
"In other words, credit is a method of making reciprocity formal, legally enforceable, and extensible to a large group of unrelated people."
The resources provided may be financial (e.g.
"granting a loan), or they may consist of goods or services (e.g."
consumer credit).
Credit encompasses any form of deferred payment.
"Credit is extended by a creditor, also known as a lender, to a debtor, also known as a borrower."
Competition is a rivalry where two or more parties strive for a common goal which cannot be shared: where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a zero-sum game).
"Competition can arise between entities such as organisms, individuals, economic and social groups, etc."
"The rivalry can be over attainment of any exclusive goal, including recognition: (e.g."
"awards, goods, mates, status, prestige), leadership, market share, niches and scarce resources, or a territory."
"Competition occurs in nature, between living organisms which co-exist in the same environment."
"Animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other biological resources."
"Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of wealth, power, prestige, and fame when in a static, repetitive, or unchanging environment."
"Competition is a major tenet of market economies and business, often associated with business competition as companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers."
Competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.
"Competition is often considered to be the opposite of cooperation, however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm."
"In economies, as the philosopher R. G. Collingwood argued ""the presence of these two opposites together is essential to an economic system."
"The parties to an economic action co-operate in competing, like two chess players""."
Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as game theory.
"Competition has been studied in several fields, including psychology, sociology and anthropology."
"Social psychologists, for instance, study the nature of competition."
They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances.
"They also study group dynamics, to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are."
"Sociologists, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole."
"Additionally, anthropologists study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures."
"They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various cultural settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time."
A plantlet is a young or small plant.Many plants such as spider plants naturally create stolons with plantlets on the ends as a form of asexual reproduction.
Vegetative propagules or clippings of mature plants may form plantlets.
An example is mother of thousands.
Many plants reproduce by throwing out long shoots or runners that can grow into new plants.
"Mother of thousands appears to have lost the ability to reproduce sexually and make seeds, but transferred at least part of the embryo-making process to the leaves to make plantlets."
"In mathematics, sine and cosine are trigonometric functions of an angle."
"The sine and cosine of an acute angle are defined in the context of a right triangle: for the specified angle, its sine is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse), and the cosine is the ratio of the length of the adjacent leg to that of the hypotenuse."
"For an angle 
  
    
      
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \theta }
  , the sine and cosine functions are denoted simply as 
  
    
      
        sin
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \sin \theta }
   and 
  
    
      
        cos
        ⁡
        θ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \cos \theta }
  .More generally, the definitions of sine and cosine can be extended to any real value in terms of the lengths of certain line segments in a unit circle."
"More modern definitions express the sine and cosine as infinite series, or as the solutions of certain differential equations, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to complex numbers."
"The sine and cosine functions are commonly used to model periodic phenomena such as sound and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year."
"The functions sine and cosine can be traced to the functions jyā and koṭi-jyā, used in Indian astronomy during the Gupta period (Aryabhatiya and Surya Siddhanta), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic, and then from Arabic to Latin."
"The word sine (Latin sinus) comes from a Latin mistranslation by Robert of Chester of the Arabic jiba, itself a transliteration of the Sanskrit word for half of a chord, jya-ardha."
The word cosine derives from a contraction of the medieval Latin complementi sinus.
"A dental drill or handpiece is a hand-held, mechanical instrument used to perform a variety of common dental procedures, including removing decay, polishing fillings, performing cosmetic dentistry, and altering prostheses."
"The handpiece itself consists of internal mechanical components which initiate a rotational force and provide power to the cutting instrument, usually a dental burr."
The type of apparatus used clinically will vary depending on the required function dictated by the dental procedure.
"It is common for a light source and cooling water-spray system to also be incorporated into certain handpieces; this improves visibility, accuracy and overall success of the procedure."
The burrs are usually made of tungsten carbide or diamond.
"A hairball is a small collection of hair or fur formed in the stomach of animals, and uncommonly in humans, that is occasionally vomited up when it becomes too big."
"Hairballs are primarily a tight elongated cylinder of packed fur, but may include bits of other elements such as swallowed food."
"Animals with hairballs are sometimes mistaken as having other conditions of the stomach such as lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and tumor of the spleen."
"Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur, and thereby ingest it."
"Rabbits are also prone to hairballs because they groom themselves in the same fashion as cats, but hairballs are especially dangerous for rabbits because they cannot regurgitate them."
"Due to the digestive systems of rabbits being very fragile, hairballs in rabbits must be treated immediately or they may cause the animal to stop feeding and ultimately die due to dehydration."
"Cattle are also known to accumulate hairballs but, as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can be quite large."
Space Shuttle Columbia (OV-102) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured by Rockwell International and operated by NASA.
"Named after the first American ship to circumnavigate the upper North American Pacific coast and the female personification of the United States, Columbia was the first of five Space Shuttle orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden flight in April 1981."
"As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle Enterprise, Columbia retained unique features indicative of its experimental design compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines."
"In addition to a heavier fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made Columbia the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around 1,000 kilograms (2,200 pounds) heavier than Challenger and 3,600 kilograms (7,900 pounds) heavier than Endeavour."
"Columbia also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an external scientific instrument bay on its vertical stabilizer."
"During its 22 years of operation, Columbia was flown on 28 missions in the Space Shuttle program, spending over 300 days in space and completing over 4,000 orbits around Earth."
"While it was seldom used after completing its objective of testing the Space Shuttle system, and its heavier mass and internal airlock made it unideal for planned Shuttle-Centaur launches and dockings with space stations, it nonetheless proved useful as a workhorse for scientific research in orbit following the loss of Challenger in 1986."
"Columbia was used for eleven of the fifteen flights of Spacelab laboratories, all four United States Microgravity Payload missions, and the only flight of Spacehab's Research Double Module."
"The Extended Duration Orbiter pallet was used by the orbiter in thirteen of the pallet's fourteen flights, which aided lengthy stays in orbit for scientific and technological research missions."
"Columbia was also used to retrieve the Long Duration Exposure Facility and deploy the Chandra observatory, and also carried into space the first female commander of an American spaceflight mission, the first ESA astronaut, the first female astronaut of Indian origin, and the first Israeli astronaut."
"At the end of its final flight in February 2003, Columbia disintegrated upon reentry, killing the seven-member crew of STS-107 and destroying most of the scientific payloads aboard."
The Columbia Accident Investigation Board convened shortly afterwards concluded that damage sustained to the orbiter's left wing during the launch of STS-107 fatally compromised the vehicle's thermal protection system.
The loss of Columbia and its crew led to a refocusing of NASA's human exploration programs and led to the establishment of the Constellation program in 2005 and the eventual retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011.
"Numerous memorials and dedications were made to honor the crew following the disaster; the Columbia Memorial Space Center was opened as a national memorial for the accident, and the Columbia Hills in Mars' Gusev crater, which the Spirit rover explored, were named after the crew."
"The majority of Columbia's recovered remains are stored at the Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building, though some pieces are on public display at the nearby Visitor Complex."
"Adhesive, also known as glue, cement, mucilage, or paste, is any non-metallic substance applied to one or both surfaces of two separate items that  binds them together and resists their separation.The use of adhesives offers certain advantages over other binding techniques such as sewing, mechanical fastenings, or welding."
"These include the ability to bind different materials together, the more efficient distribution of stress across a joint, the cost-effectiveness of an easily mechanized process, and greater flexibility in design."
"Disadvantages of adhesive use include decreased stability at high temperatures, relative weakness in bonding large objects with a small bonding surface area, and greater difficulty in separating objects during testing."
"Adhesives are typically organized by the method of adhesion followed by reactive or non-reactive, a term which refers to whether the adhesive chemically reacts in order to harden."
"Alternatively, they can be organized either by their starting physical phase or whether their raw stock is of natural or synthetic origin."
Adhesives may be found naturally or produced synthetically.
"The earliest human use of adhesive-like substances was approximately 200,000 years ago, when Neanderthals produced tar from the dry distillation of birch bark for use in binding stone tools to wooden handles."
The first references to adhesives in literature appeared in approximately 2000 BC.
The Greeks and Romans made great contributions to the development of adhesives.
"In Europe, glue was not widely used until the period AD 1500–1700."
From then until the 1900s increases in adhesive use and discovery were relatively gradual.
"Only since the last century has the development of synthetic adhesives accelerated rapidly, and innovation in the field continues to the present."
"Minutes, also known as minutes of meeting (abbreviation MoM), protocols or, informally, notes, are the instant written record of a meeting or hearing."
"They typically describe the events of the meeting and may include a list of attendees, a statement of the issues considered by the participants, and related responses or decisions for the issues."
A carriage is a private four-wheeled vehicle for people and is most commonly horse-drawn.
"Second-hand private carriages were common public transport, the equivalent of modern cars used as taxis."
"Carriage suspensions are by leather strapping and, on those made in recent centuries, steel springs."
Two-wheeled carriages are informal and usually owner-driven.
Coaches are a special category within carriages.
They are carriages with four corner posts and a fixed roof.
"Two-wheeled war chariots and transport vehicles such as four-wheeled wagons and two-wheeled carts were forerunners of carriages.In the twenty-first century, horse-drawn carriages are occasionally used for public parades by royalty and for traditional formal ceremonies."
Simplified modern versions are made for tourist transport in warm countries and for those cities where tourists expect open horse-drawn carriages to be provided.
Simple metal sporting versions are still made for the sport known as competitive driving.
Insects (from Latin insectum) are pancrustacean hexapod invertebrates of the class Insecta.
They are the largest group within the arthropod phylum.
"Insects have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae."
Insects are the most diverse group of animals; they include more than a million described species and represent more than half of all known living organisms.
The total number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million; potentially over 90% of the animal life forms on Earth are insects.
"Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, which are dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans, which recent research has indicated insects are nested within."
Nearly all insects hatch from eggs.
Insect growth is constrained by the inelastic exoskeleton and development involves a series of molts.
"The immature stages often differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat, and can include a passive pupal stage in those groups that undergo  four-stage metamorphosis."
Insects that undergo three-stage metamorphosis lack a pupal stage and adults develop through a series of nymphal stages.
The higher level relationship of the insects is unclear.
"Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the Paleozoic Era, including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in)."
The most diverse insect groups appear to have coevolved with flowering plants.
"Adult insects typically move about by walking, flying, or sometimes swimming."
"As it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles, composed of the front and rear on one side with the middle on the other side."
"Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight, and all flying insects derive from one common ancestor."
"Many insects spend at least part of their lives under water, with larval adaptations that include gills, and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming."
"Some species, such as water striders, are capable of walking on the surface of water."
"Insects are mostly solitary, but some, such as certain bees, ants and termites, are social and live in large, well-organized colonies."
"Some insects, such as earwigs, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young."
Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways.
Male moths can sense the pheromones of female moths over great distances.
"Other species communicate with sounds: crickets stridulate, or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males."
Lampyrid beetles communicate with light.
"Humans regard certain insects as pests, and attempt to control them using insecticides, and a host of other techniques."
"Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves, fruits, or wood."
"Some species are parasitic, and may vector diseases."
"Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases."
"Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on which most organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere would be devastated."
Many insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit.
Silkworms produce silk and honey bees produce honey and both have been domesticated by humans.
"Insects are consumed as food in 80% of the world's nations, by people in roughly 3000 ethnic groups."
Human activities also have effects on insect biodiversity.
Sweetness is a basic taste most commonly perceived when eating foods rich in sugars.
Sweet tastes are generally regarded as pleasurable.
"In addition to sugars like sucrose, many other chemical compounds are sweet, including aldehydes, ketones, and sugar alcohols."
"Some are sweet at very low concentrations, allowing their use as non-caloric sugar substitutes."
Such non-sugar sweeteners include saccharin and aspartame.
"Other compounds, such as miraculin, may alter perception of sweetness itself."
"The perceived intensity of sugars and high-potency sweeteners, such as aspartame and neohesperidin dihydrochalcone, are heritable, with gene effect accounting for approximately 30% of the variation.The chemosensory basis for detecting sweetness, which varies between both individuals and species, has only begun to be understood since the late 20th century."
"One theoretical model of sweetness is the multipoint attachment theory, which involves multiple binding sites between a sweetness receptor and a sweet substance."
"Studies indicate that responsiveness to sugars and sweetness has very ancient evolutionary beginnings, being manifest as chemotaxis even in motile bacteria such as E. coli."
"Newborn human infants also demonstrate preferences for high sugar concentrations and prefer solutions that are sweeter than lactose, the sugar found in breast milk."
"Sweetness appears to have the highest taste recognition threshold, being detectable at around 1 part in 200 of sucrose in solution."
"By comparison, bitterness appears to have the lowest detection threshold, at about 1 part in 2 million for quinine in solution."
"In the natural settings that human primate ancestors evolved in, sweetness intensity should indicate energy density, while bitterness tends to indicate toxicity."
The high sweetness detection threshold and low bitterness detection threshold would have predisposed our primate ancestors to seek out sweet-tasting (and energy-dense) foods and avoid bitter-tasting foods.
"Even amongst leaf-eating primates, there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves, which tend to be higher in protein and lower in fibre and poisons than mature leaves."
"The 'sweet tooth' thus has an ancient heritage, and while food processing has changed consumption patterns, human physiology remains largely unchanged."
Knight-service was a form of feudal land tenure under which a knight held a fief or estate of land termed a knight's fee (fee being synonymous with fief) from an overlord conditional on him as tenant performing military service for his overlord.
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
"An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae (see list of plants known as orange); it primarily refers to Citrus × sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus × aurantium, referred to as bitter orange."
The sweet orange reproduces asexually (apomixis through nucellar embryony); varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations.The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata).
"The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo."
"The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.The orange originated in a region encompassing Southern China, Northeast India, and Myanmar, and the earliest mention of the sweet orange was in Chinese literature in 314 BC."
"As of 1987, orange trees were found to be the most cultivated fruit tree in the world."
Orange trees are widely grown in tropical and subtropical climates for their sweet fruit.
"The fruit of the orange tree can be eaten fresh, or processed for its juice or fragrant peel."
"As of 2012, sweet oranges accounted for approximately 70% of citrus production.In 2019, 79 million tonnes of oranges were grown worldwide, with Brazil producing 22% of the total, followed by China and India."
A parent  is a caregiver of the offspring in their own species.
"In humans, a parent is the caretaker of a child (where ""child"" refers to offspring, not necessarily age)."
"A biological parent is a person whose gamete resulted in a child, a male through the sperm, and a female through the ovum."
Biological parents are first-degree relatives and have 50% genetic meet.
A female can also become a parent through surrogacy.
"Some parents may be adoptive parents, who nurture and raise an offspring, but are not biologically related to the child."
Orphans without adoptive parents can be raised by their grandparents or other family members.
"It is not legal for parents to sell their kids, for profit or not, and be able to trade them against their will."
A parent can also be elaborated as an ancestor removed one generation.
"With recent medical advances, it is possible to have more than two biological parents."
"Examples of third biological parents include instances involving surrogacy or a third person who has provided DNA samples during an assisted reproductive procedure that has altered the recipients' genetic material.The most common types of parents are mothers, fathers, step-parents, and grandparents."
"A mother is, ""a woman in relation to a child or children to whom she has given birth."""
"The extent to which it is socially acceptable for a parent to be involved in their offspring's life varies from culture to culture, however one that exhibits too little involvement is sometimes said to exhibit child neglect, while one that is too involved is sometimes said to be overprotective, cosseting, nosey, or intrusive."
"In the fields of sociology and political science, authority is the legitimate power of a person or group over other people."
"In a civil state, authority is practiced in ways such a judicial branch or an executive branch of government.In the exercise of governance, the terms authority and power are inaccurate synonyms."
"The term authority identifies the political legitimacy, which grants and justifies the ruler’s right to exercise the power of government; and the term power identifies the ability to accomplish an authorized goal, either by compliance or by obedience; hence, authority is the power to make decisions and the legitimacy to make such legal decisions and order their execution."
A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train.
"If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload, it is usually rather referred to as a multiple unit, motor coach, railcar or power car; the use of these self-propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains, but rare for freight (see CargoSprinter and Iron Highway)."
"Traditionally, locomotives pulled trains from the front."
"However, push-pull operation has become common, where the train may have a locomotive (or locomotives) at the front, at the rear, or at each end."
Most recently railroads have begun adopting DPU or distributed power.
The front may have one or two locomotives followed by a mid train locomotive that is controlled remotely from the lead unit.
"A time limit or deadline is a narrow field of time, or a particular point in time, by which an objective or task must be accomplished."
"Once that time has passed, the item may be considered overdue (e.g., for work projects or school assignments)."
"In the case of work assignments or projects that are not completed by the deadline, this may adversely affect the employee's performance rating."
"In the case of school assignments, essays or reports submitted after the deadline, marks or grades may be deducted from the student's assessment."
"In some cases, no materials can be submitted after the deadline."
"This may occur with calls for proposal, commercial tenders for bids, and application dates for universities and professional schools."
"For tests and examinations in schools, universities and job competitions, once the time limit for the test is up, the test-takers must put down their pens or pencils and hand in their test."
"In project management, deadlines are most often associated with milestones."
"Time-based performance targets per se do not affect an individual sense of empowerment as much as the task uncertainty, which arises with frequent changes to such a target."
"The atmosphere of Earth, commonly known as air, is the layer of gases retained by Earth's gravity that surrounds the planet and forms its planetary atmosphere."
"The atmosphere of Earth protects life on Earth by creating pressure allowing for liquid water to exist on the Earth's surface, absorbing ultraviolet solar radiation, warming the surface through heat retention (greenhouse effect), and reducing temperature extremes between day and night (the diurnal temperature variation)."
"By mole fraction (i.e., by number of molecules), dry air contains 78.08% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other gases."
"Air also contains a variable amount of water vapor, on average around 1% at sea level, and 0.4% over the entire atmosphere."
"Air composition, temperature, and atmospheric pressure vary with altitude."
"Within the atmosphere, air suitable for use in photosynthesis by terrestrial plants and breathing of terrestrial animals is found only in Earth's troposphere.Earth's early atmosphere consisted of gases in the solar nebula, primarily hydrogen."
"The atmosphere changed significantly over time, affected by many factors such as volcanism, life, and weathering."
"Recently, human activity has also contributed to atmospheric changes, such as global warming, ozone depletion and acid deposition."
"The atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15×1018 kg, three quarters of which is within about 11 km (6.8 mi; 36,000 ft) of the surface."
"The atmosphere becomes thinner with increasing altitude, with no definite boundary between the atmosphere and outer space."
"The Kármán line, at 100 km (62 mi) or 1.57% of Earth's radius, is often used as the border between the atmosphere and outer space."
Atmospheric effects become noticeable during atmospheric reentry of spacecraft at an altitude of around 120 km (75 mi).
"Several layers can be distinguished in the atmosphere, based on characteristics such as temperature and composition."
"The study of Earth's atmosphere and its processes is called atmospheric science (aerology), and includes multiple subfields, such as climatology and atmospheric physics."
Early pioneers in the field include Léon Teisserenc de Bort and Richard Assmann.
The study of historic atmosphere is called paleoclimatology.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental and behavioral disorder in which an individual has intrusive thoughts and/or feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly to the extent where it induces distress or impairs general function.
"As indicated by the disorder's name, the primary symptoms of OCD are obsessions and compulsions."
"Obsessions are persistent unwanted thoughts, mental images, or urges that generate feelings of anxiety, disgust, or discomfort."
"Common obsessions include fear of contamination, obsession with symmetry, and intrusive thoughts about religion, sex, and harm."
Compulsions are repeated actions or routines that occur in response to obsessions.
"Common compulsions include excessive hand washing, cleaning, arranging things, counting, seeking reassurance, and checking things."
"Many adults with OCD are aware that their compulsions do not make sense, but they perform them anyway to relieve the distress caused by obsessions."
"Compulsions occur so often, typically taking up at least one hour per day, that they impair one's quality of life.The cause of OCD is unknown."
"There appear to be some genetic components, and it is more likely for both identical twins to be affected than both fraternal twins."
Risk factors include a history of child abuse or other stress-inducing events; some cases have occurred after streptococcal infections.
Diagnosis is based on presented symptoms and requires ruling out other drug-related or medical causes; rating scales such as the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) assess severity.
"Other disorders with similar symptoms include generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, eating disorders, tic disorders, and obsessive–compulsive personality disorder."
"The condition is also associated with a general increase in suicidality.Treatment for OCD may involve psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy such as antidepressants, or surgical procedures such as deep brain stimulation (DBS)."
"CBT increases exposure to obsessions and prevents compulsions, while metacognitive therapy encourages ritual behaviors to alter the relationship to one's thoughts about them."
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a common antidepressant used to treat OCD.
"SSRIs are more effective when used in excess of the recommended depression dosage; however, higher doses can increase side-effect intensity."
"Commonly used SSRIs include sertraline, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, citalopram, and escitalopram."
Some patients fail to improve after taking the maximum tolerated dose of multiple SSRIs for at least two months; these cases qualify as treatment-resistant and require second-line treatment such as clomipramine or atypical antipsychotic augmentation.
"Surgery may be used as a final resort in the most severe or treatment-resistant cases, though most procedures are considered experimental due to the limited literature on their side effects."
"Without treatment, OCD often lasts decades.Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their lives, while rates during any given year are about 1.2%."
"It is unusual for symptoms to begin after age 35, and around 50% of patients experience detrimental effects to daily life before age 20."
"Males and females are affected equally, and OCD occurs worldwide."
"The phrase obsessive–compulsive is sometimes used in an informal manner unrelated to OCD to describe someone as excessively meticulous, perfectionistic, absorbed, or otherwise fixated."
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.
"The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness."
"A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care."
"Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories."
Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.
"Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received."
A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students  and auxiliary healthcare students.
A health science  facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic.
Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g.
surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology.
Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units.
"Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology."
"Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations."
"Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers."
"However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals."
"In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original ""places of hospitality"", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers."
The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of a primate's torso.
"In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants."
Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues.
"At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development in female humans and to a much lesser extent in other primates."
Breast development in other primate females generally only occurs with pregnancy.
"Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its size and shape."
"At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals."
"During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding."
"Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics."
"Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography."
They can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness.
A number of cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent.
"Breasts, especially the nipples, are an erogenous zone."
"A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism, and that is not due to any immediate external injury."
Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms.
A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions.
"For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies and autoimmune disorders."
"In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person afflicted, or similar problems for those in contact with the person."
"In this broader sense, it sometimes includes injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, isolated symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts and for other purposes these may be considered distinguishable categories."
"Diseases can affect people not only physically, but also mentally, as contracting and living with a disease can alter the affected person's perspective on life."
Death due to disease is called death by natural causes.
"There are four main types of disease: infectious diseases, deficiency diseases, hereditary diseases (including both genetic diseases and non-genetic hereditary diseases), and physiological diseases."
"Diseases can also be classified in other ways, such as communicable versus non-communicable diseases."
"The deadliest diseases in humans are coronary artery disease (blood flow obstruction), followed by cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections."
"In developed countries, the diseases that cause the most sickness overall are neuropsychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety."
"The study of disease is called pathology, which includes the study of etiology, or cause."
A shrub (often called a bush) is a small- to medium-sized perennial woody plant.
"Unlike herbaceous plants, shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground."
Shrubs can be deciduous or evergreen.
"They are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height, less than 6–10 m (20–33 ft) tall."
"Small shrubs, less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall are sometimes termed subshrubs."
"Many botanical groups have species that are shrubs, and others that are trees and herbaceous plants."
Some definitions state that a shrub is less than 6 m (20 ft) and tree is over 6 m. Others use 10 m (33 ft) as the cut-off point.
"Many species of tree may not reach this mature height because of less than ideal growing conditions, and resemble a shrub-sized plant."
However such species have the potential to grow taller under the ideal growing conditions for that plant.
"In terms of longevity, most shrubs fit in between perennials and trees; some may only last about five years even in good conditions, others, usually the larger and more woody, may live to 70 or more."
"Shrubland is natural landscape dominated by various shrubs; there are many distinct types around the world, including fynbos, maquis, shrub-steppe, shrub swamp and moorland."
"In gardens and parks, an area largely dedicated to shrubs (now somewhat less fashionable than a century ago) is called a shrubbery, shrub border or shrub garden."
"There are many garden cultivars of shrubs, bred for flowering, for example rhododendrons, and sometimes leaf colour or shape."
"Compared to trees and herbaceous plants, perhaps a relatively small number of shrubs have agricultural or commercial uses."
"Apart from several berry-bearing species (using the culinary rather than botanical definition), few are eaten directly, and they are generally too small for timber use."
"Those that are used include several perfumed species such as lavender and rose, and a wide range of plants with medicinal uses."
"Tea and coffee are on the tree-shrub boundary; they are normally harvested from shrub-sized plants, but these would become small trees if left to grow."
"An egg is the organic vessel containing the zygote in which an embryo develops until it can survive on its own, at which point the animal hatches."
An egg results from fertilization of an egg cell.
"Most arthropods, vertebrates (excluding live-bearing mammals), and mollusks lay eggs, although some, such as scorpions, do not."
"Reptile eggs, bird eggs, and monotreme eggs are laid out of water and are surrounded by a protective shell, either flexible or inflexible."
Eggs laid on land or in nests are usually kept within a warm and favorable temperature range while the embryo grows.
"When the embryo is adequately developed it hatches, i.e., breaks out of the egg's shell."
"Some embryos have a temporary egg tooth they use to crack, pip, or break the eggshell or covering."
The largest recorded egg is from a whale shark and was 30 cm × 14 cm × 9 cm (11.8 in × 5.5 in × 3.5 in) in size.
Whale shark eggs typically hatch within the mother.
"At 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) and up to 17.8 cm × 14 cm (7.0 in × 5.5 in), the ostrich egg is the largest egg of any living bird, though the extinct elephant bird and some non-avian dinosaurs laid larger eggs."
"The bee hummingbird produces the smallest known bird egg, which weighs half of a gram (around 0.02 oz)."
"Some eggs laid by reptiles and most fish, amphibians, insects, and other invertebrates can be even smaller."
"Reproductive structures similar to the egg in other kingdoms are termed ""spores,"" or in spermatophytes ""seeds,"" or in gametophytes ""egg cells""."
Artillery is a class of heavy military ranged weapons built to launch munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry firearms.
"Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach defensive walls and fortifications during sieges, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines."
"As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery cannons developed for battlefield use."
This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility generally providing the largest share of an army's total firepower.
"Originally, the word ""artillery"" referred to any group of soldiers primarily armed with some form of manufactured weapon or armor."
"Since the introduction of gunpowder and cannon, ""artillery"" has largely meant cannons, and in contemporary usage, usually refers to shell-firing guns, howitzers, mortars, and rocket artillery."
"In common speech, the word ""artillery"" is often used to refer to individual devices, along with their accessories and fittings, although these assemblages are more properly called ""equipment""."
"However, there is no generally recognized generic term for a gun, howitzer, mortar, and so forth: the United States uses ""artillery piece"", but most English-speaking armies use ""gun"" and ""mortar""."
"The projectiles fired are typically either ""shot"" (if solid) or ""shell"" (if not solid)."
"Historically, variants of solid shot including canister, chain shot and grapeshot were also used."
"""Shell"" is a widely used generic term for a projectile, which is a component of munitions."
"By association, artillery may also refer to the arm of service that customarily operates such engines."
"In some armies, the artillery arm has operated field, coastal, anti-aircraft, and anti-tank artillery; in others these have been separate arms, and with some nations coastal has been a naval or marine responsibility."
"In the 20th century, technology-based target acquisition devices (such as radar) and systems (such as sound ranging and flash spotting) emerged in order to acquire targets, primarily for artillery."
These are usually operated by one or more of the artillery arms.
"The widespread adoption of indirect fire in the early 20th century introduced the need for specialist data for field artillery, notably survey and meteorological, and in some armies, provision of these are the responsibility of the artillery arm."
Artillery has been used since at least the early Industrial Revolution.
"The majority of combat deaths in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and World War II were caused by artillery."
"In 1944, Joseph Stalin said in a speech that artillery was ""the God of War""."
"Rasheed Abdul Wallace (born September 17, 1974) is an American men's basketball coach for the Memphis Tigers, and former professional basketball player."
"A native of Philadelphia, Wallace played college basketball at the University of North Carolina before declaring for the draft in 1995, where he'd play 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
"Originally selected by the Washington Bullets (now known as the Washington Wizards) as the fourth pick in the 1995 NBA draft, Wallace was named to the All-Rookie second team following his first season."
He was then traded to the Portland Trail Blazers after the season.
"With Portland he was a key member of the Trail Blazers team that made it to the Western Conference Finals in 1999 and 2000, and was an NBA All-Star in 2000 and 2001."
Wallace averaged a career best 19.4 points per game in 2002 for the Trail Blazers.
During the 2003–04 season Portland traded him to the Atlanta Hawks where he played one game before he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.
"With the Pistons, Wallace won the NBA championship in 2004, and reached the NBA Finals in the following season before losing to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games."
"Individually, Wallace was an NBA All-Star in 2006 and 2008."
"After the 2008–09 season, Wallace left the Pistons as a free agent and signed with the Boston Celtics, where he played until retiring in 2010."
He returned to sign a one-year deal to play for the New York Knicks in 2012.
"On April 17, 2013, Wallace announced his second retirement."
Wallace holds the single-season record for technical fouls.
"In the 2000–01 season, Wallace received 41 technical fouls over a span of 80 games, about one technical foul for every two games."
"A well is an excavation or structure created in the ground by digging, driving, or drilling to access liquid resources, usually water."
"The oldest and most common kind of well is a water well, to access groundwater in underground aquifers."
"The well water is drawn up by a pump, or using containers, such as buckets, that are raised mechanically or by hand."
Water can also be injected back into the aquifer through the well.
"Wells were first constructed at least eight thousand years ago and historically vary in construction from a simple scoop in the sediment of a dry watercourse to the qanats of Iran, and the stepwells and sakiehs of India."
"Placing a lining in the well shaft helps create stability, and linings of wood or wickerwork date back at least as far as the Iron Age."
"Wells have traditionally been sunk by hand digging, as is still the case in rural areas of the developing world."
"These wells are inexpensive and low-tech as they use mostly manual labour, and the structure can be lined with brick or stone as the excavation proceeds."
A more modern method called caissoning uses pre-cast reinforced concrete well rings that are lowered into the hole.
"Driven wells can be created in unconsolidated material with a well hole structure, which consists of a hardened drive point and a screen of perforated pipe, after which a pump is installed to collect the water."
"Deeper wells can be excavated by hand drilling methods or machine drilling, using a bit in a borehole."
Drilled wells are usually cased with a factory-made pipe composed of steel or plastic.
Drilled wells can access water at much greater depths than dug wells.
"Two broad classes of well are shallow or unconfined wells completed within the uppermost saturated aquifer at that location, and deep or confined wells, sunk through an impermeable stratum into an aquifer beneath."
A collector well can be constructed adjacent to a freshwater lake or stream with water percolating through the intervening material.
"The site of a well can be selected by a hydrogeologist, or groundwater surveyor."
Water may be pumped or hand drawn.
Impurities from the surface can easily reach shallow sources and contamination of the supply by pathogens or chemical contaminants needs to be avoided.
Well water typically contains more minerals in solution than surface water and may require treatment before being potable.
Soil salination can occur as the water table falls and the surrounding soil begins to dry out.
Another environmental problem is the potential for methane to seep into the water.
Afrocarpus falcatus (syn.
Podocarpus falcatus) is a species of tree in the family Podocarpaceae.
"It is native to the montane forests of southern Africa, where it is distributed in Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, and Eswatini."
"Common names include common yellowwood, bastard yellowwood, outeniqua yellowwood, African pine tree, weeping yew, Afrikaans: outeniekwageelhout, kalander, Sotho: mogôbagôba, Xhosa: umkhoba and Zulu: umsonti."
"It is widespread, in some areas abundant, and not considered threatened, but it is a protected tree in South Africa."
"It is grown as an ornamental tree, especially in South Africa, and occasionally abroad."
Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity.
Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.
"It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation."
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
"If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands."
"In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains."
"On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass."
"The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes."
"The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities."
"Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics."
Antarctica is the driest continent.
"The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in)."
Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
Rainfall is measured using rain gauges.
Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.
"Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water."
"A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath."
"It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross."
"There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations."
"Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it."
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones.
The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
"The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use."
Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.
"It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology."
It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
"For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics)."
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
"There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g."
"hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc."
"Urban planning, also known as regional planning, town planning, city planning, or rural planning, is a technical and political process that is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks and their accessibility."
"Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements."
"The primary concern was the public welfare, which included considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities."
"Over time, urban planning has adopted a focus on the social and environmental bottom-lines that focus on planning as a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards."
Sustainable development was added as one of the main goals of all planning endeavors in the late 20th century when the detrimental economic and the environmental impacts of the previous models of planning had become apparent.
"Similarly, in the early 21st century, Jane Jacob's writings on legal and political perspectives to emphasize the interests of residents, businesses and communities effectively influenced urban planners to take into broader consideration of resident experiences and needs while planning."
"Urban planning answers questions about how people will live, work and play in a given area and thus, guides orderly development in urban, suburban and rural areas."
"Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities, urban planners are also responsible for planning the efficient transportation of goods, resources, people and waste; the distribution of basic necessities such as water and electricity; a sense of inclusion and opportunity for people of all kinds, culture and needs; economic growth or business development; improving health and conserving areas of natural environmental significance that actively contributes to reduction in CO2 emissions as well as protecting heritage structures and built environments."
"Urban planning is a dynamic field since the questions around how people live, work and play changes with time."
"These changes are constantly reflected in planning methodologies, zonal codes and policies making it a highly technical, political, social, economical and environmental field."
"Urban planning is an interdisciplinary field that includes civil engineering, architecture, human geography, politics, social science and design sciences."
"Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking, Engineering architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management."
"It is closely related to the field of urban design and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas."
"Urban planners work with the cognate fields of civil engineering, landscape architecture, architecture, and public administration to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals."
"Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields though today, urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline."
"The discipline of urban planning is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as land-use planning, zoning, economic development, environmental planning, and transportation planning."
Creating the plans requires a thorough understanding of penal codes and zonal codes of planning.
"Another important aspect of urban planning is that the range of urban planning projects include the large-scale master planning of empty sites or Greenfield projects as well as small-scale interventions and refurbishments of existing structures, buildings and public spaces."
"Pierre Charles L'Enfant in Washington DC, Daniel Burnham in Chicago and Georges-Eugene Haussmann in Paris planned cities from scratch, and Robert Moses and Le Corbusier refurbished and transformed cities and neighbourhoods to meet their ideas of urban planning."
Pippin or Pepin is a masculine given name of Frankish origin with uncertain meaning.
"The name was borne by various members of the Carolingian family that ruled the Austrasian Empire in the Middle Ages, in what is now France and the western parts of Germany."
"Most notable, Pepin the Short, the first Carolingian king of the Franks and father of Charlemagne."
"Other variations of the name are Peppin, Pipin, Pippin (German), Pépin (French), Pepijn (Dutch), Pepino (Italian) or Pepe (Spanish)."
"Musical chairs, also known as Trip to Jerusalem, is a game of elimination involving players, chairs, and music."
It is a staple of many parties worldwide.
"Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl), a chemical compound belonging to the larger class of salts; salt in the form of a natural crystalline mineral is known as rock salt or halite."
Salt is present in vast quantities in seawater.
"The open ocean has about 35 g (1.2 oz) of solids per liter of sea water, a salinity of 3.5%."
"Salt is essential for life in general, and saltiness is one of the basic human tastes."
"Salt is one of the oldest and most ubiquitous food seasonings, and salting is an important method of food preservation."
"Some of the earliest evidence of salt processing dates to around 6,000 BC, when people living in the area of present-day Romania boiled spring water to extract salts; a salt-works in China dates to approximately the same period."
"Salt was also prized by the ancient Hebrews, the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Hittites, Egyptians, and the Indians."
"Salt became an important article of trade and was transported by boat across the Mediterranean Sea, along specially built salt roads, and across the Sahara on camel caravans."
The scarcity and universal need for salt have led nations to go to war over it and use it to raise tax revenues.
Salt is used in religious ceremonies and has other cultural and traditional significance.
"Salt is processed from salt mines, and by the evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools."
"Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products."
"Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, about 6% is used for human consumption."
"Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use."
Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an anti-caking agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency.
"As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods."
Sodium is an essential nutrient for human health via its role as an electrolyte and osmotic solute.
"Excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults."
Such health effects of salt have long been studied.
"Accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods."
"The World Health Organization recommends that adults consume less than 2,000 mg of sodium, equivalent to 5 grams of salt per day."
"In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (that is, eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence."
They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function).
"For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively."
"In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant."
"Limit inferior is also called infimum limit, limit infimum, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit."
"The limit inferior of a sequence

"A cherry is the fruit of many plants of the genus Prunus, and is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit)."
"Commercial cherries are obtained from cultivars of several species, such as the sweet Prunus avium and the sour Prunus cerasus."
"The name 'cherry' also refers to the cherry tree and its wood, and is sometimes applied to almonds and visually similar flowering trees in the genus Prunus, as in ""ornamental cherry"" or ""cherry blossom""."
"Wild cherry may refer to any of the cherry species growing outside cultivation, although Prunus avium is often referred to specifically by the name ""wild cherry"" in the British Isles."
"A title is one or more words used before or after a person's name, in certain contexts."
"It may signify either generation, an official position, or a professional or academic qualification."
"In some languages, titles may be inserted between the first and last name (for example, Graf in German, Cardinal in Catholic usage (Richard Cardinal Cushing) or clerical titles such as Archbishop)."
Some titles are hereditary.
The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications.
The name is a contraction of binary digit.
The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values.
"These values are most commonly represented as either ""1"" or ""0"", but other representations such as true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off are commonly used."
"The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program."
It may be physically implemented with a two-state device.
"The symbol for the binary digit is either 'bit' per recommendation by the IEC 80000-13:2008 standard, or the lowercase character 'b', as recommended by the IEEE 1541-2002 standard."
"A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a single-dimensional (or multi-dimensional) bit array."
"A group of eight binary digits is called one byte, but historically the size of the byte is not strictly defined."
"Frequently, half, full, double and quadruple words consist of a number of bytes which is a low power of two."
"In information theory, one bit is the information entropy of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability, or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known."
"As a unit of information, the bit is also known as a shannon, named after Claude E. Shannon."
"Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers."
The word also refers to the materials used to upholster something.
"Upholstery comes from the Middle English word upholder, which referred to an artisan who makes fabric furnishings."
"The term is equally applicable to domestic, automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design."
A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer.
An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer.
"Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up."
"In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on."
Presbyterianism is a part of the Reformed tradition within Protestantism that traces its origin to the Church of Scotland.
Presbyterian churches derive their name from the presbyterian form of church government by representative assemblies of elders.
"Many Reformed churches are organised this way, but the word Presbyterian, when capitalized, is often applied uniquely to churches that trace their roots to the Church of Scotland or to English dissenter groups that formed during the English Civil War."
"Presbyterian theology typically emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of the Scriptures, and the necessity of grace through faith in Christ."
"Presbyterian church government was ensured in Scotland by the Acts of Union in 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain."
"In fact, most Presbyterians found in England can trace a Scottish connection, and the Presbyterian denomination was also taken to North America, mostly by Scots and Scotch-Irish immigrants."
"The Presbyterian denominations in Scotland hold to the Reformed theology of John Calvin and his immediate successors, although there is a range of theological views within contemporary Presbyterianism."
"Local congregations of churches which use Presbyterian polity are governed by sessions made up of representatives of the congregation (elders); a conciliar approach which is found at other levels of decision-making (presbytery, synod and general assembly)."
"There are roughly 75 million Presbyterians in the world.The roots of Presbyterianism lie in the Reformation of the 16th century, the example of John Calvin's Republic of Geneva being particularly influential."
Most Reformed churches that trace their history back to Scotland are either presbyterian or congregationalist in government.
"In the twentieth century, some Presbyterians played an important role in the ecumenical movement, including the World Council of Churches."
"Many Presbyterian denominations have found ways of working together with other Reformed denominations and Christians of other traditions, especially in the World Communion of Reformed Churches."
"Some Presbyterian churches have entered into unions with other churches, such as Congregationalists, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists."
"Presbyterians in the United States came largely from Scottish immigrants, Scots-Irish immigrants, and also from New England Yankee communities that had originally been Congregational but changed because of an agreed-upon Plan of Union of 1801 for frontier areas."
"An industrial park (also known as industrial estate, trading estate) is an area zoned and planned for the purpose of industrial development."
"An industrial park can be thought of as a more ""heavyweight"" version of a business park or office park, which has offices and light industry, rather than heavy industry."
"Industrial parks are often notable for being relatively economic to build and speedily erected single-space steel sheds, occasionally in bright colours."
"A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.)"
is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans.
"Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers, although the average bus usually carries between 30 to 100."
"The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads for double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads for midibuses and minibuses, while coaches are used for longer-distance services."
"Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare."
"Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, do not charge a fare."
"In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence."
"Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles."
"Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882."
"The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895."
"Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel."
"As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world."
"History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning ""inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation"") is the study and the documentation of the past."
Events before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
"""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events."
"Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect."
"Historians  often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
"Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends."
History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
"However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the ""father of history"" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the ""father of lies""."
"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies."
"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
"The saddle is a supportive structure for a rider of an animal, fastened to an animal's back by a girth."
The most common type is the equestrian saddle designed for a horse.
"However, specialized saddles have been created for oxen, camels and other animals."
"It is not known precisely when riders first began to use some sort of padding or protection, but a blanket attached by some form of surcingle or girth was probably the first ""saddle"", followed later by more elaborate padded designs."
"The solid saddle tree was a later invention, and though early stirrup designs predated the invention of the solid tree, the paired stirrup, which attached to the tree, was the last element of the saddle to reach the basic form that is still used today."
"Today, modern saddles come in a wide variety of styles, each designed for a specific equestrianism discipline, and require careful fit to both the rider and the horse."
"Proper saddle care can extend the useful life of a saddle, often for decades."
"The saddle was a crucial step in the increased use of domesticated animals, during the Classical Era."
"An egg case or egg capsule, often colloquially called a mermaid's purse, is the casing that surrounds the eggs of oviparous sharks, skates and chimaeras."
"Egg cases typically contain one embryo, except for big skate and mottled skate egg cases, which contain up to 7 embryos."
Oviparity is completely absent in the superorder Squalomorphii.
Solanum pseudocapsicum is a nightshade species with mildly poisonous fruit.
"It is commonly known as the Jerusalem cherry, Madeira winter cherry, or, ambiguously, ""winter cherry""."
"These perennials can be grown decoratively as house plants, but in some areas of South Africa, India, Australia and New Zealand it is regarded as a weed."
"The Sirenia (), commonly referred to as sea-cows or sirenians, are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous mammals that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters."
"The Sirenia currently comprise two distinct families: Dugongidae (the dugong and the now extinct Steller's sea cow) and Trichechidae (manatees, namely the Amazonian manatee, West Indian manatee, and West African manatee) with a total of four species."
The Protosirenidae (Eocene sirenians) and Prorastomidae (terrestrial sirenians) families are extinct.
"Sirenians are classified in the clade Paenungulata, alongside the elephants and the hyraxes, and evolved in the Eocene 50 million years ago (mya)."
"The Dugongidae diverged from the Trichechidae in the late Eocene or early Oligocene (30–35 mya).Sirenians grow to between 2.5 and 4 metres (8.2 and 13.1 feet) in length and 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds) in weight."
"The historic Steller's sea cow was the largest known sirenian to have lived, and could reach lengths of 10 metres (33 feet) and weights of 5 to 10 tonnes (5.5 to 11.0 short tons).Sirenians have a large, fusiform body to reduce drag through the water."
They have heavy bones that act as ballast to counteract the buoyancy of their blubber.
"They have a thin layer of blubber and consequently are sensitive to temperature fluctuations, which cause migrations when water temperatures dip too low."
"Sirenians are slow-moving, typically coasting at 8 kilometres per hour (5.0 miles per hour), but they can reach 24 kilometres per hour (15 miles per hour) in short bursts."
"They use their strong lips to pull out seagrasses, consuming 10–15% of their body weight per day."
"While breathing, they hold just their nostrils above the surface, sometimes standing on their tails to do so."
"Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers."
"They are mainly herbivorous, but have been known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish."
"Males typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating."
"Sirenians are K-selected, and display parental care."
"The meat, oil, bones, and skins are valuable items sold in markets."
"Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and watercraft collisions."
Steller's sea cow went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.
"Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)."
"Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit."
"Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail."
"The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet."
"With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration."
"Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors."
"A leg is a weight-bearing and locomotive anatomical structure, usually having a columnar shape."
"During locomotion, legs function as ""extensible struts""."
"The combination of movements at all joints can be modeled as a single, linear element capable of changing length and rotating about an omnidirectional ""hip"" joint."
As an anatomical animal structure it is used for locomotion.
The distal end is often modified to distribute force (such as a foot).
Most animals have an even number of legs.
"As a component of furniture, it is used for the economy of materials needed to provide the support for the useful surface such as the table top or chair seat."
"A toothbrush is an oral hygiene tool used to clean the teeth, gums, and tongue."
"It consists of a head of tightly clustered bristles, atop of which toothpaste can be applied, mounted on a handle which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth."
"They should be used in conjunction with something to clean between the teeth where the bristles of the toothbrush cannot reach - for example floss, tape or interdental brushes."
"They are available with different bristle textures, sizes, and forms."
"Most dentists recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard-bristled toothbrushes can damage tooth enamel and irritate the gums.Because many common and effective ingredients in toothpaste are harmful if swallowed in large doses and instead should be spat out, the act of brushing teeth is most often done at a sink within the kitchen or bathroom, where the brush may be rinsed off afterwards to remove any debris remaining and then dried to reduce conditions ideal for germ growth (and, if it is a wooden toothbrush, mold as well)."
"Some toothbrushes have plant based handles, often bamboo."
"However, numerous others are made of cheap plastic; such brushes constitute a significant source of pollution."
Over 1 billion toothbrushes are disposed of into landfills annually in the United States alone.
"Bristles are commonly made of nylon (which, while not biodegradable, as plastic is, may still be recycled) or bamboo viscose."
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes  class Actinopterygii, known colloquially as flying fish or flying cod."
About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera.
"While they cannot fly in the same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where their long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface."
"The main reason for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others, though their periods of flight expose them to attack by avian predators such as frigate birds."
"Barbados is known as ""the land of the flying fish"", and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country."
"The Exocet missile is named after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take a low trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets."
"The oldest known fossil of a flying or gliding fish, Potanichthys xingyiensis, dates back to the Middle Triassic, 235–242 million years ago."
"However, this fossil is probably not related to modern flying fish, which are thought to have evolved independently about 66 million years ago."
"The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the United States government tasked with  the enforcement of federal law and administration of justice in the United States."
It is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries.
"The department is headed by the U.S. Attorney General, who reports directly to the president of the United States and is a member of the president's Cabinet."
"The current attorney general is Merrick Garland, who was sworn in March 11, 2021.The modern incarnation of the department was formed in 1870 during the Ulysses S. Grant presidency."
"The department is composed of federal law enforcement agencies, including the U.S."
"Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Prisons."
"The primary actions of the DOJ are investigating instances of white collar crime, representing the U.S. government in legal matters (such as in cases before the Supreme Court), and running the federal prison system."
The department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local law enforcement as directed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.
"Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory."
"Rights are of essential importance in such disciplines as law and ethics, especially theories of justice and deontology."
Rights are fundamental to any civilization and the history of social conflicts is often bound up with attempts both to define and to redefine them.
"According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ""rights structure the form of governments, the content of laws, and the shape of morality as it is currently perceived""."
"A barnacle is a type of arthropod constituting the subclass Cirripedia in the subphylum Crustacea, and is hence related to crabs and lobsters."
"Barnacles are exclusively marine, and tend to live in shallow and tidal waters, typically in erosive settings."
"They are sessile (nonmobile) and most are suspension feeders,  but those in infraclass Rhizocephala are highly specialized parasites on crustaceans."
They have four nektonic (active swimming) larval stages.
"Around 1,000 barnacle species are currently known."
"The name ""Cirripedia"" is Latin, meaning ""curl-footed""."
The study of barnacles is called cirripedology.
"The tomato is the edible berry of the plant Solanum lycopersicum, commonly known as a tomato plant."
The species originated in western South America and Central America.
"The Mexican Nahuatl word tomatl gave rise to the Spanish word tomate, from which the English word tomato derived."
Its domestication and use as a cultivated food may have originated with the indigenous peoples of Mexico.
"The Aztecs used tomatoes in their cooking at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, and after the Spanish encountered the tomato for the first time after their contact with the Aztecs, they brought the plant to Europe, in a widespread transfer of plants known as the Columbian exchange."
"From there, the tomato was introduced to other parts of the European-colonized world during the 16th century.Tomatoes are a significant source of umami flavor."
"The tomato is consumed in diverse ways, raw or cooked, in many dishes, sauces, salads, and drinks."
"While tomatoes are fruits—botanically classified as berries—they are commonly used culinarily as a vegetable ingredient or side dish.Numerous varieties of the tomato plant are widely grown in temperate climates across the world, with greenhouses allowing for the production of tomatoes throughout all seasons of the year."
Tomato plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height.
They are vines that have a weak stem that sprawls and typically needs support.
"Indeterminate tomato plants are perennials in their native habitat, but are cultivated as annuals."
"(Determinate, or bush, plants are annuals that stop growing at a certain height and produce a crop all at once.)"
"The size of the tomato varies according to the cultivar, with a range of 1–10 cm (1⁄2–4 in) in width."
The past is the set of all events that occurred before a given point in time.
The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future.
"The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection."
"In addition, human beings have recorded the past since the advent of written language."
"The first known use of the word ""past"" was in the fourteenth century; it developed as the past participle of the middle English verb passen meaning ""to pass."""
"A security alarm is a system designed to detect intrusion, such as unauthorized entry, into a building or other areas such as a home or school."
"Security alarms used in residential, commercial, industrial, and military properties protect against burglary (theft) or property damage, as well as personal protection against intruders."
Security alerts in neighborhoods show a connection with diminished robbery.
Car alarms likewise help protect vehicles and their contents.
Prisons also use security systems for the control of inmates.
Some alarm systems serve a single purpose of burglary protection; combination systems provide fire and intrusion protection.
Intrusion-alarm systems are combined with closed-circuit television surveillance (CCTV) systems to record intruders' activities and interface to access control systems for electrically locked doors.
There are many types of security systems.
"Homeowners typically have small, self-contained noisemakers."
"These devices can also be complicated, multirole systems with computer monitoring and control."
It may even include a two-way voice which allows communication between the panel and monitoring station.
"Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked."
"In their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies."
"The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such as baking soda or baking powder."
"Common additional ingredients and flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary ingredients."
"Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays."
"There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old."
"Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake."
The trumpet is a brass instrument commonly used in classical and jazz ensembles.
"The trumpet group ranges from the piccolo trumpet with the highest register in the brass family, to the bass trumpet, which is pitched one octave below the standard B♭ or C Trumpet."
"Trumpet-like instruments have historically been used as signaling devices in battle or hunting, with examples dating back to at least 1500 BC."
They began to be used as musical instruments only in the late 14th or early 15th century.
"Trumpets are used in art music styles, for instance in orchestras, concert bands, and jazz ensembles, as well as in popular music."
"They are played by blowing air through nearly-closed lips (called the player's embouchure), producing a ""buzzing"" sound that starts a standing wave vibration in the air column inside the instrument."
"Since the late 15th century, trumpets have primarily been constructed of brass tubing, usually bent twice into a rounded rectangular shape.There are many distinct types of trumpet, with the most common being pitched in B♭ (a transposing instrument), having a tubing length of about 1.48 m (4 ft 10 in)."
"Early trumpets did not provide means to change the length of tubing, whereas modern instruments generally have three (or sometimes four) valves in order to change their pitch."
"Most trumpets have valves of the piston type, while some have the rotary type."
"The use of rotary-valved trumpets is more common in orchestral settings (especially in German and German-style orchestras), although this practice varies by country."
A musician who plays the trumpet is called a trumpet player or trumpeter.
"In physiology, respiration is the movement of oxygen from the outside environment to the cells within tissues, and the removal of carbon dioxide in the opposite direction.The physiological definition of respiration differs from the biochemical definition, which refers to a metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy (in the form of ATP and NADPH) by oxidizing nutrients and releasing waste products."
"Although physiologic respiration is necessary to sustain cellular respiration and thus life in animals, the processes are distinct: cellular respiration takes place in individual cells of the organism, while physiologic respiration concerns the diffusion and transport of metabolites between the organism and the external environment."
Gas exchanges in the lung occurs by ventilation and perfusion.
Ventilation refers to the in and out movement of air of the lungs and perfusion is the circulation of blood in the pulmonary capillaries.
"In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths."
Inhalation (breathing in) is usually an active movement that brings air into the lungs where the process of gas exchange takes place between the air in the alveoli and the blood in the pulmonary capillaries.
"Contraction of the diaphragm muscle cause a pressure variation, which is equal to the pressures caused by elastic, resistive and inertial components of the respiratory system."
"In contrast, exhalation (breathing out) is usually a passive process."
"The process of breathing does not fill the alveoli with atmospheric air during  each inhalation (about 350 ml per breath), but the inhaled air is carefully diluted and thoroughly mixed with a large volume of gas (about 2.5 liters in adult humans) known as the functional residual capacity which remains in the lungs after each exhalation, and whose gaseous composition differs markedly from that of the ambient air."
"Physiological respiration involves the mechanisms that ensure that the composition of the functional residual capacity is kept constant, and equilibrates with the gases dissolved in the pulmonary capillary blood, and thus throughout the body."
"Thus, in precise usage, the words breathing and ventilation are hyponyms, not synonyms, of respiration; but this prescription is not consistently followed, even by most health care providers, because the term respiratory rate (RR) is a well-established term in health care, even though it would need to be consistently replaced with ventilation rate if the precise usage were to be followed."
During respiration the C-H bonds are broken by oxidation-reduction reaction and so carbon dioxide and water are also produced.
The cellular energy-yielding process is called cellular respiration.
"The Dogon (or Kaador, Kaado) are an ethnic group indigenous to the central plateau region of Mali, in West Africa, south of the Niger bend, near the city of Bandiagara, and in Burkina Faso."
"The population numbers between 400,000 and 800,000."
"They speak the Dogon languages, which are considered to constitute an independent branch of the Niger–Congo language family, meaning that they are not closely related to any other languages.The Dogon are best known for their religious traditions, their mask dances, wooden sculpture, and their architecture."
"Since the twentieth century, there have been significant changes in the social organisation, material culture and beliefs of the Dogon, in part because Dogon country is one of Mali's major tourist attractions."
"A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals."
"In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards."
"Some women with hirsutism, a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard."
"Throughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's fashion trends."
Some religions (such as Islam and Sikhism) have considered a full beard to be essential and mandate it as part of their observance.
"Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's virility, exemplifying such virtues as wisdom, strength, sexual prowess and high social status."
"In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor."
"In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements."
"Daiquiri  (; Spanish: daiquirí [dajkiˈɾi]) is a family of cocktails whose main ingredients are rum, citrus juice (typically lime juice), and sugar or other sweetener."
"The daiquiri is one of the six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's classic The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, which also lists some variations."
Pole dance combines dance and acrobatics centered on a vertical pole.
"This performance art form takes place not only in gentleman's clubs as erotic dance, but also as a mainstream form of fitness, practiced in gyms and dedicated dance studios."
"Pole dancing enthusiasts are of all ages; although many who perform this dance and acrobatic form are adults, that does not stop younger children from learning and performing in competitions."
Amateur and professional pole dancing competitions are held in countries around the world.
"Pole dance requires significant muscular endurance and coordination, as well as sensuality."
"Today, pole performances by exotic dancers range from basic spins and striptease in more intimate clubs to athletic moves such as climbs and body inversions in the ""stage heavy"" clubs of Las Vegas and Miami."
"Dancer Remy Redd at the King of Diamonds, for example, is famous for flipping herself upside down into a split and hanging from the ceiling."
Pole dance requires significant strength and flexibility.
"Upper body and core strength are required to attain proficiency, and proper instruction and rigorous training are necessary."
"Since the mid-2000s, promoters of pole dance fitness competitions have tried to change peoples' perception of pole dance to include pole fitness as a non-sexual form of dance and acrobatics and are trying to move pole into the Olympics as pole sports."
Pole dance is regarded as a form of exercise which can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout.
Recognized schools and qualifications are now commonplace.
"An interrogative word or question word is a function word used to ask a question, such as what, which, when, where, who, whom, whose, why, whether and how."
"They are sometimes called wh-words, because in English most of them start with wh- (compare Five Ws)."
They may be used in both direct questions (Where is he going?)
and in indirect questions (I wonder where he is going).
In English and various other languages the same forms are also used as relative pronouns in certain relative clauses (The country where he was born) and certain adverb clauses (I go where he goes).
"It can also be used as a modal, since question words are more likely to appear in modal sentences, like (Why was he walking?)"
"A particular type of interrogative word is the interrogative particle, which serves to convert a statement into a yes–no question, without having any other meaning."
"Examples include est-ce que in French, ли li in Russian, czy in Polish, ĉu in Esperanto, কি ki in Bengali, 嗎/吗 ma in Mandarin Chinese, mı/mi in Turkish, pa in Ladin, か ka in Japanese, 까 kka in Korean, ko/kö in Finnish and (да) ли (da) li in Serbo-Croatian."
"Such particles contrast with other interrogative words, which form what are called wh-questions rather than yes–no questions."
"For more information about the grammatical rules for forming questions in various languages, see Interrogative."
The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom.
"British scientific intelligence at the Air Ministry fought back with a variety of their own increasingly effective means, involving jamming and deception signals."
"The period ended when the Wehrmacht moved their forces to the East in May 1941, in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union.The idea of ""beam"" based navigation was developed during the 1930s, initially as a blind landing aid."
The basic concept is to produce two directional radio signals that are aimed slightly to the left and right of a runway's midline.
Radio operators in the aircraft listen for these signals and determine which of the two beams they are flying in.
"This is normally accomplished by sending Morse code signals into the two beams, to identify right and left."
"For bombing, the Luftwaffe built huge versions of the antennas to provide much greater accuracy at long range, named Knickebein and X-Gerät."
"These were used during the early stages of ""The Blitz"" with great effect, in one case laying a strip of bombs down the centerline of a factory deep in England."
"Tipped off about the system's operation by pre-war military intelligence, the British responded by sending their own Morse code signals so that the aircraft believed they were always properly centred in the beam while they flew wildly off course."
The Germans became convinced the British had somehow learned to bend radio signals.
"When the problem became widespread, the Germans introduced a new system that worked on different principles, the Y-Gerät."
"Having guessed the nature of this system from a passing mention, the British had already deployed countermeasures that rendered the system useless almost as soon as it was used."
"The Germans eventually gave up on the entire concept of radio navigation over the UK, concluding the British would continue to successfully jam it."
A system is a group of interacting or interrelated elements that act according to a set of rules to form a unified whole.
"A system, surrounded and influenced by its environment, is described by its boundaries, structure and purpose and expressed in its functioning."
Systems are the subjects of study of systems theory and other systems sciences.
"Knowledge is a familiarity or awareness, of someone or something, such as facts (descriptive knowledge), skills (procedural knowledge), or objects (acquaintance knowledge) contributing to ones understanding."
"By most accounts, knowledge can be acquired in many different ways and from many sources, including but not limited to perception, reason, memory, testimony, scientific inquiry, education, and practice."
The philosophical study of knowledge is called epistemology.
"The term ""knowledge"" can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject."
It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); formal or informal; systematic or particular.
"The philosopher Plato argued that there was a distinction between knowledge and true belief in the Theaetetus, leading many to attribute to him a definition of knowledge as ""justified true belief""."
The difficulties with this definition raised by the Gettier problem have been the subject of extensive debate in epistemology for more than half a century.
"In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a transmission medium such as a gas, liquid or solid."
"In human physiology and psychology, sound is the reception of such waves and their perception by the brain."
"Only acoustic waves that have  frequencies lying between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz, the audio frequency range, elicit an auditory percept in humans."
"In air at atmospheric pressure, these represent sound waves with wavelengths of 17 meters (56 ft) to 1.7 centimetres (0.67 in)."
Sound waves above 20 kHz are known as ultrasound and are not audible to humans.
Sound waves below 20 Hz are known as infrasound.
Different animal species have varying hearing ranges.
"A ruby is a pink-ish red to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide)."
Ruby is one of the most popular traditional jewelry gems and is very durable.
Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires.
"Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, alongside amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond."
"The word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red."
The color of a ruby is due to the element chromium.
"Some gemstones that are popularly or historically called rubies, such as the Black Prince's Ruby in the British Imperial State Crown, are actually spinels."
"These were once known as ""Balas rubies""."
"The quality of a ruby is determined by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value."
"The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality."
"After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any needle-like rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated."
"Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually pinker than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies."
The world's most valuable ruby to be sold at auction is the Sunrise Ruby.
"Breakfast is the first meal of the day eaten after waking from the night's sleep, in the morning."
The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.
"There is a strong likelihood for one or more ""typical"", or ""traditional"", breakfast menus to exist in most places, but their composition varies widely from place to place, and has varied over time, so that globally a very wide range of preparations and ingredients are now associated with breakfast."
"Eggs are laid by female animals of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, a few mammals, and fish, and many of these have been eaten by humans for thousands of years."
"Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes."
The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs.
Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten.
Fish eggs are called roe and caviar.
"Egg yolks and whole eggs store significant amounts of protein and choline, and are widely used in cookery."
"Due to their protein content, the United States Department of Agriculture formerly categorized eggs as Meats within the Food Guide Pyramid (now MyPlate)."
"Despite the nutritional value of eggs, there are some potential health issues arising from cholesterol content, salmonella contamination, and allergy to egg proteins."
Chickens and other egg-laying creatures are kept widely throughout the world and mass production of chicken eggs is a global industry.
"In 2009, an estimated 62.1 million metric tons of eggs were produced worldwide from a total laying flock of approximately 6.4 billion hens."
"There are issues of regional variation in demand and expectation, as well as current debates concerning methods of mass production."
"In 2012, the European Union banned battery husbandry of chickens."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
Rotex Electric is a Czech aircraft engine manufacturer based in Prague.
"The company specializes in the design and manufacture of electric motors for light aircraft, as well as for automobiles and other applications.The company was founded in 2003.The company produces four series of electric motors, REB, REG, RET and REX, in a variety of power outputs."
"The REB 90 is an example, a brushless 350 volt design that produces 80 kW (107 hp) for aircraft use."
Artemis is a 2017 science fiction novel written by Andy Weir.
"The novel takes place in the late 2080s in Artemis, the first and so far only city on the Moon."
"It follows the life of porter and smuggler Jasmine ""Jazz"" Bashara as she gets caught up in a conspiracy for control of the city."
"The novel was highly praised by readers on Goodreads, who voted it the best sci-fi novel of the year."
The novel's audiobook is narrated by Rosario Dawson.
Beine is a commune in the Yonne department in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté in north-central France.
The orbital plane of a revolving body is the geometric plane in which its orbit lies.
Three non-collinear points in space suffice to determine an orbital plane.
A common example would be the positions of the centers of a massive body (host) and of an orbiting celestial body at two different times/points of its orbit.
The orbital plane is defined in relation to a reference plane by two parameters: inclination (i) and longitude of the ascending node (Ω).
"By definition, the reference plane for the Solar System is usually considered to be Earth's orbital plane, which defines the ecliptic, the circular path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow over the course of a year."
"In other cases, for instance a moon or artificial satellite orbiting another planet, it is convenient to define the inclination of the Moon's orbit as the angle between its orbital plane and the planet's equatorial plane."
"A rechargeable battery, storage battery, or secondary cell (formally a type of energy accumulator), is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged into a load, and recharged many times, as opposed to a disposable or primary battery, which is supplied fully charged and discarded after use."
It is composed of one or more electrochemical cells.
"The term ""accumulator"" is used as it accumulates and stores energy through a reversible electrochemical reaction."
"Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network."
"Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used, including lead–acid, zinc–air, nickel–cadmium (NiCd), nickel–metal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion (Li-ion), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and lithium-ion polymer (Li-ion polymer)."
"Rechargeable batteries typically initially cost more than disposable batteries, but have a much lower total cost of ownership and environmental impact, as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing."
"Some rechargeable battery types are available in the same sizes and voltages as disposable types, and can be used interchangeably with them."
Billions of dollars in research are being invested around the world for improving batteries and industry also focuses on building better batteries.
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
"In multicellular organisms, stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can differentiate into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell."
They are the earliest type of cell in a cell lineage.
"They are found in both embryonic and adult organisms, but they have slightly different properties in each."
"They are usually distinguished from progenitor cells, which cannot divide indefinitely, and precursor or blast cells, which are usually committed to differentiating into one cell type."
"In mammals, roughly 50–150 cells make up the inner cell mass during the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, around days 5–14."
These have stem-cell capability.
"In vivo, they eventually differentiate into all of the body's cell types (making them pluripotent)."
"This process starts with the differentiation into the three germ layers – the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – at the gastrulation stage."
"However, when they are isolated and cultured in vitro, they can be kept in the stem-cell stage and are known as embryonic stem cells (ESCs)."
"Adult stem cells are found in a few select locations in the body, known as niches, such as those in the bone marrow or gonads."
"They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are multipotent or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell."
"In mammals, they include, among others, hematopoietic stem cells, which replenish blood and immune cells, basal cells, which maintain the skin epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, which maintain bone, cartilage, muscle and fat cells."
"Adult stem cells are a small minority of cells; they are vastly outnumbered by the progenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells that they differentiate into.Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Canadian biologists Ernest McCulloch, James Till and Andrew J. Becker at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the 1960s."
"As of 2016, the only established medical therapy using stem cells is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, first performed in 1958 by French oncologist Georges Mathé."
"Since 1998 however, it has been possible to culture and differentiate human embryonic stem cells (in stem-cell lines)."
"The process of isolating these cells has been controversial, because it typically results in the destruction of the embryo."
"Sources for isolating ESCs have been restricted in some European countries and Canada, but others such as the UK and China have promoted the research."
Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a cloning method that can be used to create a cloned embryo for the use of its embryonic stem cells in stem cell therapy.
"In 2006, a Japanese team led by Shinya Yamanaka discovered a method to convert mature body cells back into stem cells."
These were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
"A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world's oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying goods or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research, and fishing."
"Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity, and purpose."
"In the Age of Sail a ""ship"" was a sailing vessel defined by its sail plan of at least three square rigged masts and a full bowsprit."
"Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, imperialism, and science."
"After the 15th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth."
Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
"As of 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion dead weight tons."
"Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships."
A rainbow flag is a multicolored flag consisting of the colors of the rainbow.
"The designs differ, but many of the colors are based on the spectral colors of the visible light spectrum."
"When Isaac Newton first saw a rainbow through a prism, he labeled the colors red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet."
"However, when not seen through a prism, the color he deemed ""blue"" is actually blue-green, or cyan, what he called ""violet"" is today known as dark blue, and ""indigo"" is a normal blue.The LGBT flag introduced in 1979 is the most recognized use of the rainbow flag."
Aggressive panhandling is a legal term for unlawful forms of public begging.
Proponents of such legislation advocate placing limits on these activities.
"Some opponents lament what they perceive to be the ""criminalization of homelessness"" and argue that such laws are discriminatory or unevenly enforced."
"Sheep dip is a liquid formulation of insecticide and fungicide which shepherds and farmers use to protect their sheep from infestation against external parasites such as itch mite (Psoroptes ovis), blow-fly, ticks and lice."
"Biologically, a child (plural children) is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty, or between the developmental period of infancy and puberty."
"The legal definition of child generally refers to a minor, otherwise known as a person younger than the age of majority."
Children generally have fewer rights and responsibilities than adults.
They are classed as unable to make serious decisions.
"Child may also describe a relationship with a parent (such as sons and daughters of any age) or, metaphorically, an authority figure, or signify group membership in a clan, tribe, or religion; it can also signify being strongly affected by a specific time, place, or circumstance, as in ""a child of nature"" or ""a child of the Sixties""."
"A food flavoring or food flavouring,
 in short flavoring or flavouring, or alternatively aroma is a food additive used to improve the taste or smell of food."
It changes the perceptual impression of food as determined primarily by the chemical senses of the gustatory and olfactory system.
"The ""trigeminal nerves"", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat, as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall perception of food."
"Of the three chemical senses, smell is the main determinant of a food item's flavor."
Aromas are the volatile components of the food.
The aroma of a food is determined by the aroma compounds it contains and the personal ability to detect them.
"While an aroma primarily acts through te olfactory system, it also affects the taste at the same time."
"Along with additives, other components like sugarsdetermine the taste of food."
"Five basic tastes – sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami (savory) are universally recognized, although some cultures also include pungency and oleogustus (""fattiness"")."
"The number of food smells is unbounded; a food's flavor, therefore, can be easily altered by changing its smell while keeping its taste similar."
"This is exemplified in artificially flavored jellies, soft drinks and candies, which, while made of bases with a similar taste, have dramatically different flavors due to the use of different scents or fragrances."
The flavorings of commercially produced food products are typically created by flavorists.
"A flavoring is defined as a substance that gives another substance taste, altering the characteristics of the solute, causing it to become sweet, sour, tangy, etc."
"Although the term, in common language, denotes the combined chemical sensations of taste and smell, the same term is used in the fragrance and flavors industry to refer to edible chemicals and extracts that alter the flavor of food and food products through the sense of smell."
"Owing to the high cost, or unavailability of natural flavor extracts, most commercial flavorants are ""nature-identical"", which means that they are the chemical equivalent of natural flavors, but chemically synthesized rather than being extracted from source materials."
"Identification of components of natural foods, for example a raspberry, may be done using technology such as headspace techniques, so the flavorist can imitate the flavor by using a few of the same chemicals present."
"In the EU legislation, the term ""natural-identical flavouring"" does not exist."
"The legislation is specified on what is a ""flavouring"" and a ""natural flavouring""."
A flavor is a quality of something that affects the sense of taste.
A castle is a type of fortified structure built during the Middle Ages predominantly by the nobility or royalty and by military orders.
"Scholars debate the scope of the word castle, but usually consider it to be the private fortified residence of a lord or noble."
"This is distinct from a palace, which is not fortified;
from a fortress, which was not always a residence for royalty or nobility; from a pleasance which was a walled-in residence for nobility, but not adequately fortified;
and from a fortified settlement, which was a public defence – though there are many similarities among these types of construction."
Use of the term has varied over time and has been applied to structures as diverse as hill forts and country houses.
"Over the approximately 900 years that castles were built, they took on a great many forms with many different features, although some, such as curtain walls, arrowslits, and portcullises, were commonplace."
"European-style castles originated in the 9th and 10th centuries, after the fall of the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes."
These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as offered protection from enemies.
"Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power."
"Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source."
"Many northern European castles were originally built from earth and timber, but had their defences replaced later by stone."
"Early castles often exploited natural defences, lacking features such as towers and arrowslits and relying on a central keep."
"In the late 12th and early 13th centuries, a scientific approach to castle defence emerged."
"This led to the proliferation of towers, with an emphasis on flanking fire."
Many new castles were polygonal or relied on concentric defence – several stages of defence within each other that could all function at the same time to maximise the castle's firepower.
"These changes in defence have been attributed to a mixture of castle technology from the Crusades, such as concentric fortification, and inspiration from earlier defences, such as Roman forts."
"Not all the elements of castle architecture were military in nature, so that devices such as moats evolved from their original purpose of defence into symbols of power."
Some grand castles had long winding approaches intended to impress and dominate their landscape.
"Although gunpowder was introduced to Europe in the 14th century, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15th century, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls."
"While castles continued to be built well into the 16th century, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live."
"As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible."
"From the 18th century onwards, there was a renewed interest in castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose."
"A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state."
"In federations, governor may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected."
"The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal or mostly ceremonial power, with others having complete control over the entire government."
"Historically, the title can also apply to the executive officials acting as representatives of a chartered company which has been granted exercise of sovereignty in a colonial area, such as the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company."
These companies operate as a major state within a state with its own armed forces.
"There can also be non-political governors: high-ranking officials in private or similar governance such as commercial and non-profit management, styled governor(s), who simply govern an institution, such as a corporation or a bank."
"For example, in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries, there are prison governors (""wardens"" in the United States), school governors and bank governors."
"The adjective pertaining to a governor is gubernatorial, from the Latin root gubernare."
"The obsolete term for a female governor is the female form governess, however the modern term for female officials is the gender-neutral form governor (without the gender-specific suffix -ess) to avoid confusion with other meanings of governess."
"A ball is a round object (usually spherical, but can sometimes be ovoid) with various uses."
"It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players."
"Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch or juggling."
"Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings."
Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.
"Although many types of balls are today made from rubber, this form was unknown outside the Americas until after the voyages of Columbus."
The Spanish were the first Europeans to see the bouncing rubber balls (although solid and not inflated) which were employed most notably in the Mesoamerican ballgame.
"Balls used in various sports in other parts of the world prior to Columbus were made from other materials such as animal bladders or skins, stuffed with various materials."
"As balls are one of the most familiar spherical objects to humans, the word ""ball"" may refer to or describe spherical or near-spherical objects."
"""Ball"" is used metaphorically sometimes to denote something spherical or spheroid, e.g., armadillos and human beings curl up into a ball, making a fist into a ball."
"A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed  to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work."
"Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle."
Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles.
"Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators."
"In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a ""straight truck"" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a ""tractor"".The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico."
"The market-share of electrically-powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks."
"In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles."
Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing run on oval tracks measuring approximately 0.25 to 2.66 miles (0.4 to 4.3 kilometers).
"It originally used production-model cars, hence the name ""stock car"", but is now run using cars specifically built for racing."
It originates from the United States and Canada; the world's largest governing body is the American NASCAR.
Its NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top-level series of professional stock car racing.
"Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil and the United Kingdom also have forms of stock car racing."
Top-level races typically range between 200 and 600 miles (322 and 966 km) in length.
Top-level stock cars exceed 200 mph (322 km/h) at speedway tracks and on superspeedway tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
Contemporary NASCAR-spec top-level cars produce maximum power outputs of 860–900 hp from their naturally aspirated V8 engines.
In October 2007 American race car driver Russ Wicks set a speed record for stock cars in a 2007-season Dodge Charger built to NASCAR specifications by achieving a maximum speed of 244.9 mph (394.1 km/h) at Bonneville Speedway.
"For the 2015 NASCAR Cup Series, power output of the competing cars ranged from 750 to 800 hp (560 to 600 kW)."
The rough-skinned newt or roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa) is a North American newt known for the strong toxin exuded from its skin.
"Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series mainly adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga series, with exactly 500 episodes."
"It is set two and a half years after the original series in the Naruto universe, following the ninja teenager Naruto Uzumaki and his allies."
"The series is directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Pierrot and TV Tokyo."
"It began broadcasting on February 15, 2007 on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.On January 2, 2009, Viz Media and Crunchyroll provided eight uncut English subtitled Naruto: Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website."
"Later on January 15, Viz began providing subtitled versions of the latest Naruto: Shippuden episodes a week after they first aired in Japan, with a new episode being added to the Naruto website each subsequent Thursday."
"The English dub of Naruto: Shippuden made its US premiere on Disney XD on October 28, 2009."
"On July 24, 2009, Viz Media announced that the series would be released on the iTunes Store."
"The first DVD release of the series in North America was released on September 29, 2009.Naruto: Shippuden stopped airing on Disney XD on November 5, 2011 after 98 episodes, in which the network cited more frequent violence that was shown in later episodes."
DVD box sets generally containing thirteen dubbed episodes from episode 1 onward were released quarterly in their uncut format.
"The English dub was streamed on the Neon Alley web channel from its launch in October 2012, and beginning December 29, 2012 with episode 99, dubbed episodes premiered every week uncut until March 25, 2016 after 338 episodes, about a month before Neon Alley's closure."
"Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing the anime from the beginning on January 5, 2014 in an uncut format and as of 2021 it is still running on a weekly basis."
The network started showing never before aired dubbed episodes at the 339th episode mark by May 2021.
"In four regions, episodes from the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray by single volumes and box sets."
"In North America, twelve single volumes and thirty eight box sets have been released."
"In the United Kingdom, twenty eight single volumes and six box sets have been released."
"In Japan, twenty six sets of volumes have been released based on which arc it represents."
"In Australia and New Zealand, twenty-eight collections have been released."
"Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and reduced interactions with surroundings."
"It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns."
"Sleep occurs in repeating periods, in which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM sleep and non-REM sleep."
"Although REM stands for ""rapid eye movement"", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body."
"A well-known feature of sleep is the dream, an experience typically recounted in narrative form, which resembles waking life while in progress, but which usually can later be distinguished as fantasy."
"During sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems."
The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night.
The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research.
"Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution.Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders."
The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity's sleep patterns.
One common source of artificial light are modern devices such as smartphones or televisions which have been shown to affect sleep health.
"Blue light, a specific type of artificial light, can disrupt the release of the hormone melatonin which aids in helping to facilitate sleepiness."
"A hubcap or hub cap is a decorative disk on an automobile wheel that covers at minimum the central portion of the wheel, called the hub."
An automobile hubcap is used to cover the wheel hub and the wheel fasteners to reduce the accumulation of dirt and moisture.
"It also has the function of decorating the car.A ""hubcap"" is technically the small cover over the center of the wheel, while a ""wheel cover"" is a decorative metal or plastic disk that snaps or bolts onto and covers the entire face of the wheel."
Cars with stamped steel wheels often use a full wheel cover that conceals the entire wheel.
"Cars with alloy wheels or styled steel wheels generally use smaller hubcaps, sometimes called center caps."
"Alternatively, wheel cover refers to an accessory covering an external rear-mounted spare tire (also known as a spare tire cover) found on some off-road vehicles."
"Elaphe quatuorlineata (common names: four-lined snake, Bulgarian ratsnake) is a member of the family Colubridae."
The four-lined snake is a non-venomous species and one of the largest of the European snakes.
"Abdominal pain, also known as a stomach ache, is a symptom associated with both non-serious and serious medical issues."
Common causes of pain in the abdomen include gastroenteritis and irritable bowel syndrome.
"About 15% of people have a more serious underlying condition such as appendicitis, leaking or ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, diverticulitis, or ectopic pregnancy."
"In a third of cases the exact cause is unclear.Given that a variety of diseases can cause some form of abdominal pain, a systematic approach to the examination of a person and the formulation of a differential diagnosis remains important."
"A month is a unit of time, used with calendars, that is approximately as long as a natural orbital period of the Moon; the words month and Moon are cognates."
"The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such lunar months (""lunations"") are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days."
"From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age."
"Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth–Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year."
Short hair refers to any haircut with little length.
It may vary from above the ears to below the chin.
"If a man's hair reaches the chin, it may not be considered short."
"For a woman, however, short varies from close-cropped to just above the shoulders."
"Different styles of short hair include the bob cut, the crop and the pixie cut."
"Height is  measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how ""tall"" something or someone is) or vertical position (how ""high"" a point is)."
"For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m""."
"When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude."
"Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation.In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value."
"If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero."
"In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or ""above"") the x-y plane."
An aircraft pilot or aviator is a person who controls the flight of an aircraft by operating its directional flight controls.
"Some other aircrew members, such as navigators or flight engineers, are also considered aviators, because they are involved in operating the aircraft's navigation and engine systems."
"Other aircrew members, such as drone operators, flight attendants, mechanics and ground crew, are not classified as aviators."
"In recognition of the pilots' qualifications and responsibilities, most militaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots."
"Foxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae."
"They have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush)."
"Twelve species belong to the monophyletic ""true foxes"" group of genus Vulpes."
"Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are always or sometimes called foxes; these foxes are either part of the paraphyletic group of the South American foxes, or of the outlying group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox, and island fox.Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica."
The most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with about 47 recognized subspecies.
"The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world."
"The hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in Europe, especially in the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World."
"The striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) is a species of hyena native to North and East Africa, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent."
It is the only species in the genus Hyaena.
"It is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, as the global population is estimated to be under 10,000 mature individuals which continues to experience deliberate and incidental persecution along with a decrease in its prey base such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations."
"It is also the national animal of Lebanon.It is the smallest of the true hyenas and retains many primitive viverrid characteristics lost in larger species, having a smaller and less specialised skull."
"Though primarily a scavenger, large specimens have been known to kill their own prey, and attacks on humans have occurred in rare instances."
"The striped hyena is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs."
"A nocturnal animal, the striped hyena typically only emerges in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise."
"Although it has a habit of feigning death when attacked, it has been known to stand its ground against larger predators in disputes over food.The striped hyena features prominently in Middle Eastern and Asian folklore."
"In some areas, its body parts are considered magical, and are used as charms or talismans."
"It is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, where it is referred to as tzebua or zevoa, though it is absent in some Bible translations into English."
Ancient Greeks knew it as γλάνος (glános) and ύαινα (húaina) and were familiar with it from the Aegean coast of Asia Minor.
"Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics."
Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring.
"The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand."
"Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass."
"The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology."
"Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material."
"Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures."
"Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria."
"The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience."
"Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses."
"In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles."
Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass.
"The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials."
"Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass)."
"The olfactory bulb (Latin: bulbus olfactorius) is a neural structure of the vertebrate forebrain involved in olfaction, the sense of smell."
"It sends olfactory information to be further processed in the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus where it plays a role in emotion, memory and learning."
The bulb is divided into two distinct structures: the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory bulb.
The main olfactory bulb connects to the amygdala via the piriform cortex of the primary olfactory cortex and directly projects from the main olfactory bulb to specific amygdala areas.
The accessory olfactory bulb resides on the dorsal-posterior region of the main olfactory bulb and forms a parallel pathway.
"Destruction of the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia, while irritative lesions of the uncus can result in olfactory and gustatory hallucinations."
"Forwards are the players on an association football team who play nearest to the opposing team's goal, and are therefore most responsible for scoring goals."
Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players.
"Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards; for example, the common 4–2–3–1 formation includes one forward."
"Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards, or none."
"Planetary health refers to ""the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends""."
"In 2015, the Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet launched the concept as the Rockefeller Foundation–Lancet Commission on Planetary Health."
Skeletal muscles (commonly referred to as muscles) are organs of the vertebrate muscular system that are mostly attached by tendons to bones of the skeleton.
"The muscle cells of skeletal muscles are much longer than in the other types of muscle tissue, and are often known as muscle fibers."
The muscle tissue of a skeletal muscle is striated – having a striped appearance due to the arrangement of the sarcomeres.
Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles under the control of the somatic nervous system.
"The other types of muscle are cardiac muscle which is also striated and smooth muscle which is non-striated; both of these types of muscle tissue are classified as involuntary, or, under the control of the autonomic nervous system.A skeletal muscle contains multiple fascicles – bundles of muscle fibers."
"Each individual fiber, and each muscle is surrounded by a type of connective tissue layer of fascia."
Muscle fibers are formed from the fusion of developmental myoblasts in a process known as myogenesis resulting in long multinucleated cells.
In these cells the nuclei termed myonuclei are located along the inside of the cell membrane.
Muscle fibers also have multiple mitochondria to meet energy needs.
Muscle fibers are in turn composed of myofibrils.
"The myofibrils are composed of actin and myosin filaments called myofilaments, repeated in units called sarcomeres, which are the basic functional, contractile units of the muscle fiber necessary for muscle contraction."
"Muscles are predominantly powered by the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates, but anaerobic chemical reactions are also used, particularly by fast twitch fibers."
These chemical reactions produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules that are used to power the movement of the myosin heads.
"The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and most animals including a few fish, and some snails."
"In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart."
"Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the air and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange."
Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species.
"Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing."
"In earlier tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians."
"In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm."
The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.
"Humans have two lungs, a right lung, and a left lung."
They are situated within the thoracic cavity of the chest.
"The right lung is bigger than the left, which shares space in the chest with the heart."
"The lungs together weigh approximately 1.3 kilograms (2.9 lb), and the right is heavier."
"The lungs are part of the lower respiratory tract that begins at the trachea and branches into the bronchi and bronchioles, and which receive air breathed in via the conducting zone."
The conducting zone ends at the terminal bronchioles.
"These divide into the respiratory bronchioles of the respiratory zone which divide into alveolar ducts that give rise to the alveolar sacs that contain the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place."
Alveoli are also sparsely present on the walls of the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts.
"Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres (1,500 mi) of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli."
"Each lung is enclosed within a pleural sac of two membranes called pleurae; the membranes are separated by a film of pleural fluid, which allows the inner and outer membranes to slide over each other whilst breathing takes place, without much friction."
The inner pleura also divides each lung into sections called lobes.
The right lung has three lobes and the left has two.
The lobes are further divided into  bronchopulmonary segments and  pulmonary lobules.
"The lungs have a unique blood supply, receiving deoxygenated blood from the heart in the pulmonary circulation for the purposes of receiving oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, and a separate supply of oxygenated blood to the tissue of the lungs, in the bronchial circulation."
"The tissue of the lungs can be affected by a number of respiratory diseases, including pneumonia and lung cancer."
"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and can be related to smoking or exposure to harmful substances."
"A number of occupational lung diseases can be caused by substances such as coal dust, asbestos fibres, and crystalline silica dust."
Diseases such as bronchitis can also affect the respiratory tract.
"Medical terms related to the lung often begin with pulmo-, from the Latin pulmonarius (of the lungs) as in pulmonology, or with pneumo- (from Greek πνεύμων ""lung"") as in pneumonia."
"In embryonic development, the lungs begin to develop as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the upper part of the digestive system."
When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe.
Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus.
"At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire."
The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.
A fellow is a broad concept whose exact meaning depends on context.
"In learned or professional societies, it refers to a privileged member who is specially elected in recognition of their work and achievements."
"Within the context of higher educational institutions, a fellow can be a member of a highly-ranked group of teachers at a particular college or university or a member of the governing body in some universities (such as the Fellows of Harvard College); 
it can also be a specially selected postgraduate student who has been appointed to a post (called a fellowship) granting a stipend, research facilities and other privileges for a fixed period (usually one year or more) in order to undertake some advanced study or research, often in return for teaching services."
"In the context of research and development-intensive large companies or corporations, the title ""fellow"" is sometimes given to a small number of senior scientists and engineers."
"In the context of medical education in North America, a fellow is a physician who is undergoing a supervised, sub-specialty medical training (fellowship) after having completed a specialty training program (residency)."
"Spanking is a common form of corporal punishment involving the act of striking, with either the palm of the hand or an implement, the buttocks of a person to cause them physical pain."
"Although the term spanking broadly encompasses the use of either the hand or implement, the use of implements can also refer to the administration of more specific types of corporal punishment such as caning, paddling and slippering."
Some parents spank children in response to undesired behavior.
Adults more commonly spank boys than girls both at home and in school.
"Some countries have outlawed the spanking of children in every setting, including homes, schools, and penal institutions, while others permit it when done by a parent or guardian."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats."
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
"Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures."
"Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball."
"Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities."
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
"The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers."
"In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit."
"Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g."
rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger.
"Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months."
"There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill."
"A skill is the learned ability to perform an action with determined results with good execution often within a given amount of time, energy, or both."
Skills can often be divided into domain-general and domain-specific skills.
"For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be used only for a certain job."
Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used.
"A skill may be called an art when it represents a body of knowledge or branch of learning, as in the art of medicine or the art of war."
"Although the arts are also skills, there are many skills that form an art but have no connection to the fine arts."
A practice is when the learned skill is put into practice.
"An art or skill may be the basis for a profession, trade, or craft."
People need a broad range of skills to contribute to the modern economy.
"A joint ASTD and U.S. Department of Labor study showed that through technology, the workplace is changing, and identified 16 basic skills that employees must have to be able to change with it."
"Three broad categories of skills are suggested and these are technical, human, and conceptual."
"The first two can be substituted with hard and soft skills, respectively."
"The Bible (from Koine Greek τὰ βιβλία, tà biblía, 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other faiths."
"It appears in the form of an anthology, a compilation of texts of a variety of forms, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek."
"These texts include theologically-focused historical accounts, hymns, prayers, proverbs, parables, didactic letters, admonitions, essays, poetry, and prophecies."
The collection of materials that are accepted as authoritative by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon.
Believers generally consider the Bible to be a product of divine inspiration while understanding what that means in different ways.
The origins of the oldest writings of the Israelites are lost in antiquity.
There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon was settled in its present form.
"Some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty (140–40 BCE), while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later."
"The Masoretic Text, in Hebrew and Aramaic, is considered the authoritative text by current Rabbinic Judaism, but there is also the Septuagint, a Koine Greek translation from the third century BCE, which largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible."
"Christianity began as an outgrowth of Judaism, using the Septuagint as the basis of the ""Old Testament""."
"The early Church continued the Jewish tradition of writing and incorporating what it saw as inspired, authoritative religious books, and soon the gospels, Pauline epistles and other texts coalesced into the ""New Testament""."
"In its first three centuries, the concept of a closed canon emerged in response to heretical writings in the second century."
A first list of canonical books appears in Athanasius' Easter letter from 367 AD.
The list of books included in the Catholic Bible was established as the biblical canon by the Councils of Hippo in 393 and in Carthage in 397.
"Christian biblical canons currently range from the 73 books of the Catholic Church canon, and the 66-book canon of most Protestant denominations, to the 81 books of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church canon."
"With estimated total sales of over five billion copies, the Bible is widely considered to be the best-selling book of all time."
It has had a profound direct influence on Western culture and history.
The study of the Bible through biblical criticism has indirectly impacted culture and history as well.
The Bible is currently translated or being translated into about half of the world's languages.
March is the third month of the year in both the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
It is the second of seven months to have a length of 31 days.
"In the Northern Hemisphere, the meteorological beginning of spring occurs on the first day of March."
"The March equinox on the 20 or 21 marks the astronomical beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and the beginning of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, where September is the seasonal equivalent of the Northern Hemisphere's March."
The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table (1858) is a collection of essays written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.
The essays were originally published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1857 and 1858 before being collected in book form.
"The author had written two essays with the same name which were published in the earlier The New-England Magazine in November 1831 and February 1832, which are alluded to in a mention of an ""interruption"" at the start of the first essay."
"The Lantern Festival (simplified Chinese: 元宵节; traditional Chinese: 元宵節; pinyin: Yuánxiāo jié), also called Shangyuan Festival (simplified Chinese: 上元节; traditional Chinese: 上元節; pinyin: Shàngyuán jié), is a Chinese traditional festival celebrated on the full moon, the fifteenth day of the first month in the lunisolar Chinese calendar."
"Usually falling in February or early March on the Gregorian calendar, it marks the final day of the traditional Chinese New Year celebrations."
"As early as the Western Han Dynasty (206 BCE–25 CE), it had become a festival with great significance.During the Lantern Festival, children go out at night carrying paper lanterns and solve riddles on the lanterns (traditional Chinese: 猜燈謎; simplified Chinese: 猜灯谜; pinyin: cāidēngmí)."
"In ancient times, the lanterns were fairly simple, and only the emperor and noblemen had large ornate ones."
"In modern times, lanterns have been embellished with many complex designs."
"For example, lanterns are now often made in the shape of animals."
"The lanterns can symbolize the people letting go of their past selves and getting new ones, which they will let go of the next year."
The lanterns are almost always red to symbolize good fortune.The festival acts as an Uposatha day on the Chinese calendar.
"It should not be confused with the Mid-Autumn Festival; which is sometimes also known as the ""Lantern Festival"" in locations such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore."
"Lantern Festivals have also become popular in Western countries, such as the Water Lantern Festival held in multiple locations in the United States."
"In London, the Magical Lantern Festival is held annually."
"A vice is a practice, behaviour, or habit generally considered immoral, sinful, criminal, rude, taboo, depraved, degrading, deviant or perverted in the associated society."
"In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit."
Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality.
"Synonyms for vice include fault, sin, depravity, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption."
The opposite of vice is virtue.
Hares and jackrabbits are leporids belonging to the genus Lepus.
Hares are classified in the same family as rabbits.
"They have similar herbivorous diets, but are generally larger in size than rabbits, have proportionately longer ears and live solitarily or in pairs."
"They do not dig burrows, but nest in slight depressions called forms, often in long grass."
"Also unlike rabbits, their young are able to fend for themselves shortly after birth rather than emerging blind and helpless."
"Having long, powerful hind legs, most are fast runners."
"Hare species are native to Africa, Eurasia, and  North America."
"There are five leporid species with ""hare"" in their common names that do not belong to the genus Lepus: the hispid hare (Caprolagus hispidus), and four species known as red rock hares (comprising Pronolagus)."
"In addition, several Lepus species are known as ""jackrabbits"" rather than hares."
"A hare less than one year old is called a ""leveret""."
"A group of hares is called a ""husk"", a ""down"", or a ""drove""."
Tenure is a category of academic appointment existing in some countries.
"A tenured post is an indefinite academic appointment that can be terminated only for cause or under extraordinary circumstances, such as financial exigency or program discontinuation."
"Tenure is a means of defending the principle of academic freedom, which holds that it is beneficial for society in the long run if scholars are free to hold and examine a variety of views."
"A curtain is a piece of cloth or other material intended to block or obscure light, air drafts, or (in the case of a shower curtain), water."
A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theater that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop/background.Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.
"For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons)."
"In this application, they are also known as ""draperies""."
Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portières.
"Curtains come in a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, colors, and patterns."
"They often have their own sections within department stores, while some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains."
"Curtains vary according to cleanability, ultraviolet light deterioration, oil and dust retention, noise absorption, fire resistance, and life span."
"Curtains may be operated by hand, with cords, by press-button pads or remote-controlled computers."
They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.
"Measuring curtain sizes needed for each window varies greatly according to the type of curtain needed, window size, and type and weight of curtain."
Curtains are a form of window treatment and complete the overall appearance of the interior of the house.
Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.
"The effect of drapery or curtains is best seen in daylight, and with proper indoor light positioning, can look attractive even at night."
"Transport (in British English), or transportation (in American English), is the movement of humans, animals, and goods from one location to another."
"In other words, the action of transport is defined as a particular movement of an organism or thing from a point A (a place in space) to a point B.  
Modes of transport include air, land (rail and road), water, cable, pipeline, and space."
"The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles, and operations."
"Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations."
"Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals, and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations), and seaports."
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
Means of transport are any of the different kinds of transport facilities used to carry people or cargo.
"They may include vehicles, riding animals, and pack animals."
"Vehicles may include wagons, automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft, and aircraft."
"A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river."
"In some cases, a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water."
"Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill."
"There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to  geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size."
"Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are ""run"" in some parts of the United States, ""burn"" in Scotland and northeast England, and ""beck"" in northern England."
"Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague."
Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle.
"Water generally collects in a river from precipitation through a drainage basin from surface runoff and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from glaciers)."
"Rivers and streams are often considered major features within a landscape; however, they actually only cover around 0.1% of the land on Earth."
They are made more obvious and significant to humans since many human cities and civilizations are built around the freshwater supplied by rivers and streams.
"Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers, as they are, or were, used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for transport, as borders, as a defensive measure, as a source of hydropower to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste."
"Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while limnology is the study of inland waters in general."
"Vienna ( (listen) vee-EN-ə; Austrian German: Wien [viːn] (listen); Austro-Bavarian: Wean [veɐ̯n]) is the national capital, largest city, and one of nine states of Austria."
"Vienna is Austria's most populous city, with about 2 million inhabitants (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of the country's population), and its cultural, economic, and political center."
It is the 6th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union.
"Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants."
"Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking city after Berlin."
"Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations, OPEC and the OSCE."
"The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary."
These regions work together in a European Centrope border region.
"Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants."
"In 2001, the city center was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
In July 2017 it was moved to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
"Additionally, Vienna is known as the ""City of Music"" due to its musical legacy, as many famous classical musicians such as Beethoven and Mozart called Vienna home."
"Vienna is also said to be the ""City of Dreams"" because it was home to the world's first psychoanalyst, Sigmund Freud."
Vienna's ancestral roots lie in early Celtic and Roman settlements that transformed into a Medieval and Baroque city.
"It is well known for having played a pivotal role as a leading European music center, from the age of Viennese Classicism through the early part of the 20th century."
"The historic center of Vienna is rich in architectural ensembles, including Baroque palaces and gardens, and the late-19th-century Ringstraße lined with grand buildings, monuments and parks.Vienna is known for its high quality of life."
"In a 2005 study of 127 world cities, the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked the city first (in a tie with Vancouver and San Francisco) for the world's most livable cities."
"Between 2011 and 2015, Vienna was ranked second, behind Melbourne."
"Monocle's 2015 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna second on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within""."
"Monocle's 2012 ""Quality of Life Survey"" ranked Vienna fourth on a list of the top 25 cities in the world ""to make a base within"" (up from sixth in 2011 and eighth in 2010)."
The UN-Habitat classified Vienna as the most prosperous city in the world in 2012–2013.
"The city was ranked 1st globally for its culture of innovation in 2007 and 2008, and sixth globally (out of 256 cities) in the 2014 Innovation Cities Index, which analyzed 162 indicators in covering three areas: culture, infrastructure, and markets."
Vienna regularly hosts urban planning conferences and is often used as a case study by urban planners.
"Between 2005 and 2010, Vienna was the world's number-one destination for international congresses and conventions."
It attracts over 6.8 million tourists a year.
"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), commonly referred to as Berkeley Lab, is a United States national laboratory that conducts scientific research on behalf of the Department of Energy."
"Located in the hills of Berkeley, California, the lab overlooks the campus of the University of California, Berkeley."
Soap is a salt of a fatty acid used in a variety of cleansing and lubricating products.
"In a domestic setting, soaps are surfactants usually used for washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping."
"In industrial settings, soaps are used as thickeners, components of some lubricants, and precursors to catalysts."
"When used for cleaning, soap solubilizes particles and grime, which can then be separated from the article being cleaned."
"In hand washing, as a surfactant, when lathered with a little water, soap kills microorganisms by disorganizing their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins."
"It also emulsifies oils, enabling them to be carried away by running water.Soap is created by mixing fats and oils with a base, as opposed to detergent which is created by combining chemical compounds in a mixer."
Humans have used soap for millennia.
Evidence exists of the production of soap-like materials in around 2800 BC in ancient Babylon.
"Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people, events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact."
"In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels, as well as novellas and short stories."
"More broadly, however, fiction has come to encompass imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games."
"A scarecrow is a decoy or mannequin, often in the shape of a human."
Humanoid scarecrows are usually dressed in old clothes and placed in open fields to discourage birds from disturbing and feeding on recently cast seed and growing crops.
"Scarecrows are used around the world by farmers, and are a notable symbol of farms and the countryside in popular culture."
Hygiene is a series of practices performed to preserve health.
"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""Hygiene refers to conditions and practices that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases."""
Personal hygiene refers to maintaining the body's cleanliness.
"Hygiene activities can be grouped into the following: home and everyday hygiene, personal hygiene, medical hygiene, sleep hygiene and food hygiene."
"Home and every day hygiene includes hand washing, respiratory hygiene, food hygiene at home, hygiene in the kitchen, hygiene in the bathroom, laundry hygiene and medical hygiene at home."
"Many people equate hygiene with 'cleanliness,' but hygiene is a broad term."
"It includes such personal habit choices as how frequently to take a shower or bath, wash hands, trim fingernails, and wash clothes."
"It also includes attention to keeping surfaces in the home and workplace clean, including bathroom facilities."
"Some regular hygiene practices may be considered good habits by the society, while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful, or threatening."
"Carpentry is a skilled trade and a craft in which the primary work performed is the cutting, shaping and installation of building materials during the construction of buildings, ships, timber bridges, concrete formwork, etc."
"Carpenters traditionally worked with natural wood and did rougher work such as framing, but today many other materials are also used and sometimes the finer trades of cabinetmaking and furniture building are considered carpentry."
"In the United States, 98.5% of carpenters are male, and it was the fourth most male-dominated occupation in the country in 1999."
"In 2006 in the United States, there were about 1.5 million carpentry positions."
Carpenters are usually the first tradesmen on a job and the last to leave.
Carpenters normally framed post-and-beam buildings until the end of the 19th century; now this old-fashioned carpentry is called timber framing.
"Carpenters learn this trade by being employed through an apprenticeship training—normally 4 years—and qualify by successfully completing that country's competence test in places such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and South Africa."
"It is also common that the skill can be learned by gaining work experience other than a formal training program, which may be the case in many places."
"An hour (symbol: h; also abbreviated hr) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as 1⁄24 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599–3,601 seconds, depending on conditions."
"There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day."
The hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of 1⁄12 of the night or daytime.
"Such seasonal, temporal, or unequal hours varied by season and latitude."
Equal or equinoctial hours were taken as 1⁄24 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it 1⁄24 of the mean solar day.
"Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second."
"In the modern metric system, hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds."
"However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second, making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is based on measurements of the mean solar day."
Pink is the color of a namesake flower that is a pale tint of red.
It was first used as a color name in the late 17th century.
"According to surveys in Europe and the United States, pink is the color most often associated with charm, politeness, sensitivity, tenderness, sweetness, childhood, femininity, and romance."
"A combination of pink and white is associated with chastity and innocence, whereas a combination of pink and black links to eroticism and seduction."
"A spider web, spiderweb, spider's web, or cobweb (from the archaic word coppe, meaning ""spider"") is a structure created by a spider out of proteinaceous spider silk extruded from its spinnerets, generally meant to catch its prey."
"Spider webs have existed for at least 100 million years, as witnessed in a rare find of Early Cretaceous amber from Sussex, in southern England."
Many spiders build webs specifically to trap and catch insects to eat.
"However, not all spiders catch their prey in webs, and some do not build webs at all."
"""Spider web"" is typically used to refer to a web that is apparently still in use (i.e."
"clean), whereas ""cobweb"" refers to abandoned (i.e."
dusty) webs.
"However, the word ""cobweb"" is also used by biologists to describe the tangled three-dimensional web of some spiders of the family Theridiidae."
"While this large family is known as the cobweb spiders, they actually have a huge range of web architectures; other names for this spider family include tangle-web spiders and comb-footed spiders."
The term antelope is used to refer to many species of even-toed ruminant that are indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia.
"Antelope comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing all Old World ruminants that are not bovines, caprines, deer, or giraffes."
"One New World species, the pronghorn of North America, is sometimes colloquially referred to as the ""American antelope"", but they are more closely related to the Giraffidae family."
"The ""true antelope"" are the gazelle, Nanger, Eudorcas and Antilope.A group of antelope is called a herd."
"Unlike deer antlers, which are shed and grown annually, antelope horns grow continuously."
"In humans and other primates, the knee joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two joints: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint)."
It is the largest joint in the human body.
"The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation."
The knee is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis.
It is often termed a compound joint having tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components.
(The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)
A planet is a large astronomical body that is not a star or stellar remnant.
There are competing scientific definitions of a 'planet'.
"In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects."
"The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition."
"In the geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite."
"In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology and religion."
"Apart from the Moon, five planets are visible to the naked eye in the night sky."
Planets were regarded by many early cultures as emissaries of deities or as divine themselves.
"As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, and the invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of additional planetary objects that were diverse in size, shape and orbit."
"In 2006, the IAU adopted a resolution limiting the number of planets within the Solar System, though they are not followed by all astronomers, especially planetologists."
The IAU resolution is controversial because it excludes many geologically active objects of planetary mass due to where or what they orbit.
Ptolemy thought that the planets orbited Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
"Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested before, it wasn't until the 17th century that this view was supported by the concrete evidence, in the form of telescopic observations performed by Galileo Galilei."
"About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular."
"As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and that some shared such features as ice caps and seasons."
"Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observations by space probes have found that Earth and other planets share additional characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology."
The eight Solar planets in the IAU definition are divided into two divergent types: large low-density giant planets and small rocky terrestrial planets.
"In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the four giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."
"Six are orbited by natural satellites, the two exceptions being the innermost planets Mercury and Venus."
"Under geophysical definitions, the classification is more complex: the Moon and Jupiter's moons Io and Europa are additional terrestrial planets, but a large number of small icy planets are also added, such as the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto and the other large giant-planet moons such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan."
"Beginning at the end of the twentieth century, several thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars."
"These are referred to as ""extrasolar planets"", or ""exoplanets"" for short."
"As of 1 January 2022, 4,905 extrasolar planets have been discovered in 3,629 planetary systems."
The count includes 808 multi-planetary systems.
Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon.
"More than 100 of these planets are approximately the size as Earth, nine of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star."
"In 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f."
"A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates a minimum of 1.6 bound planets on average for every star in the Milky Way."
"As of 2013, one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"Applied mathematics is the application of mathematical methods by different fields such as physics, engineering, medicine, biology, finance, business, computer science, and industry."
"Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge."
"The term ""applied mathematics"" also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models."
"In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake."
The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.
"The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot"")."
"In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo."
Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.
"The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.As with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species."
"All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size."
"The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies""."
"The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size."
"There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region."
This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees.
"A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:

wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg;
tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);
wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smallest of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females;
kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head."
"Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development."
"Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals."
Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass.
"Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite."
"The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back."
"This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees."
The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
"Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful."
"The kangaroo is a symbol of Australia, appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force."
"The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references."
"Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land."
Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.
"A globe is a spherical model of Earth, of some other celestial body, or of the celestial sphere."
"Globes serve purposes similar to maps, but unlike maps, they do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down."
A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe.
A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe.
A globe shows details of its subject.
A terrestrial globe shows landmasses and water bodies.
It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines.
Some have raised relief to show mountains and other large landforms.
"A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects."
"Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations."
"The word globe comes from the Latin word globus, meaning ""sphere""."
Globes have a long history.
"The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC."
"The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, made by Martin Behaim in 1492."
"The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire."
Sunglasses or sun glasses (informally called shades or sunnies; more names below) are a form of protective eyewear designed primarily to prevent bright sunlight and high-energy visible light from damaging or discomforting the eyes.
"They can sometimes also function as a visual aid, as variously termed spectacles or glasses exist, featuring lenses that are colored, polarized or darkened."
"In the early 20th century, they were also known as sun cheaters (cheaters then being an American slang term for glasses).Since the 1930s, sunglasses have been a popular fashion accessory, especially on the beach."
"The American Optometric Association recommends wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet radiation (UV) whenever a person is in the sunlight to protect the eyes from UV and blue light, which can cause several serious eye problems."
"Their usage is mandatory immediately after some surgical procedures, such as LASIK, and recommended for a certain time period in dusty areas, when leaving the house and in front of a TV screen or computer monitor after LASEK."
"It is important to note that dark glasses that do not block UV radiation can be more damaging to the eyes than not wearing eye protection at all, since they tend to open the pupil and allow more UV rays into the eye."
The Christian Hero is a 1735 tragedy by the British writer George Lillo.
It is based on the life of Skanderbeg who led a rebellion against the Ottoman Empire in the fifteenth century.
"Two years earlier William Havard had written Scanderbeg, another work based on his life."
"The original Drury Lane cast included William Milward as Scanderbeg, James Quin as Amurath, William Mills as Mahomet, Edward Berry as Osmyn, Sarah Thurmond as Hellena, John Mills as Aranthes, Richard Winstone as Paulinus and Theophilus Cibber as Amasie."
"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition."
"In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe."
In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.
"In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's  pouch."
It is not only mammals that give birth.
"Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them."
"Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals."

"Sea anemones are the marine, predatory animals of the order Actiniaria."
"They are named after the anemone, a terrestrial flowering plant, because of the colourful appearance of many."
"Sea anemones are classified in the phylum Cnidaria, class Anthozoa, subclass Hexacorallia."
"As cnidarians, sea anemones are related to corals, jellyfish, tube-dwelling anemones, and Hydra."
"Unlike jellyfish, sea anemones do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle."
"A typical sea anemone is a single polyp attached to a hard surface by its base, but some species live in soft sediment and a few float near the surface of the water."
The polyp has a columnar trunk topped by an oral disc with a ring of tentacles and a central mouth.
The tentacles can be retracted inside the body cavity or expanded to catch passing prey.
They are armed with cnidocytes (stinging cells).
"In many species, additional nourishment comes from a symbiotic relationship with single-celled dinoflagellates, zooxanthellae or with green algae, zoochlorellae, that live within the cells."
"Some species of sea anemone live in association with hermit crabs, small fish or other animals to their mutual benefit."
Sea anemones breed by liberating sperm and eggs through the mouth into the sea.
"The resulting fertilized eggs develop into planula larvae which, after being planktonic for a while, settle on the seabed and develop directly into juvenile polyps."
"Sea anemones also breed asexually, by breaking in half or into smaller pieces which regenerate into polyps."
"Sea anemones are sometimes kept in reef aquariums; the global trade in marine ornamentals for this purpose is expanding and threatens sea anemone populations in some localities, as the trade depends on collection from the wild."
"A secretary, administrative professional, or personal assistant is a person whose work consists of supporting management, including executives, using a variety of project management, communication, or organizational skills."
"However this role should not be confused with the role of an executive secretary, who differs from a personal assistant."
The functions of a personal assistant may be entirely carried out to assist one other employee or may be for the benefit of more than one.
"In other situations a secretary is an officer of a society or organization who deals with correspondence, admits new members, and organizes official meetings and events."
Grandparents are the parents of a person's father or mother – paternal or maternal.
"Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, etc."
"In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased."
"It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but largely results in the improved medical technology and living standard, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers."
"Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and nurture of children."
Grandparents are second-degree relatives to their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.
A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent).
"The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms gramps, granny, grandfather, granddad, grandmother, nan, maw-maw, paw-paw (and others which families make up themselves)"
Shweta Tripathi Sharma (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actress popularly known for the character of Golu Gupta in Mirzapur.
She began her film career as a production assistant and associate director and gained wider recognition and accolades for her acting performances in the Hindi film industry and web series.
Notable films include Masaan (2015) and Haraamkhor (2017).
Crown glass is a type of optical glass used in lenses and other optical components.
It has relatively low refractive index (≈1.52) and low dispersion (with Abbe numbers around 60).
Crown glass is produced from alkali-lime silicates containing approximately 10% potassium oxide and is one of the earliest low dispersion glasses.
"As well as the specific material named crown glass, there are other optical glasses with similar properties that are also called crown glasses."
"Generally, this is any glass with Abbe numbers in the range 50 to 85."
"For example, the borosilicate glass Schott BK7 is an extremely common crown glass, used in precision lenses."
"Borosilicates contain about 10% boric oxide, have good optical and mechanical characteristics, and are resistant to chemical and environmental damage."
"Other additives used in crown glasses include zinc oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, barium oxide, fluorite and lanthanum oxide."
"BAK-4 barium crown glass has a higher index of refraction than BK7, and is used for prisms in high-end binoculars."
"In that application, it gives better image quality and a round exit pupil."
A concave lens of flint glass is commonly combined with a convex lens of crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet.
"The dispersions of the glasses partially compensate for each other, producing reduced chromatic aberration compared to a singlet lens with the same focal length."
"A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a beacon for navigational aid, for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways."
"Lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, rocks, and safe entries to harbors; they also assist in aerial navigation."
"Once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and has become uneconomical since the advent of much cheaper, more sophisticated and effective electronic navigational systems."
"Sledding, sledging or sleighing is a winter sport typically carried out in a prone or seated position on a vehicle generically known as a sled (North American), a sledge (British), or a sleigh."
"It is the basis of three Olympic sports: luge, skeleton and bobsledding."
"When practised on sand, it is known as a form of sandboarding."
In Russia sledges are used for maritime activities including fishing and commuting from island to island on ice.
"A trampoline is a device consisting of a piece of taut, strong fabric stretched between a steel frame using many coiled springs."
"Not all trampolines have springs, as the Springfree Trampoline uses glass-reinforced plastic rods."
People bounce on trampolines for recreational and competitive purposes.
"The fabric that users bounce on (commonly known as the ""bounce mat"" or ""trampoline bed"") is not elastic itself; the elasticity is provided by the springs that connect it to the frame, which store potential energy."
SOAP (formerly an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol) is a messaging protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services in computer networks.
"It uses XML Information Set for its message format, and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), although some legacy systems communicate over Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission."
"SOAP allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, and Linux) to authenticate, authorize, and communicate using Extensible Markup Language (XML)."
"Since Web protocols like HTTP are installed and running on all operating systems, SOAP allows clients to invoke web services and receive responses independent of language and platforms."
A birthday card is a greeting card given or sent to a person to celebrate their birthday.
"Similar to a birthday cake, birthday card traditions vary by culture but the origin of birthday cards is unclear."
The advent of computing and introduction of the internet and social media has led to the use of electronic birthday cards or even Facebook posts to send birthday messages.
Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.
Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.
It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964.
Beach volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996.
The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
"The complete set of rules is extensive, but play essentially proceeds as follows: a player on one of the teams begins a 'rally' by serving the ball (tossing or releasing it and then hitting it with a hand or arm), from behind the back boundary line of the court, over the net, and into the receiving team's court."
The receiving team must not let the ball be grounded within their court.
"The team may touch the ball up to three times to return the ball to the other side of the court, but individual players may not touch the ball twice consecutively."
"Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack."
"An attack is an attempt to direct the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball and continue the rally, thus, losing the point."
The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and serves the ball to start the next rally.
"A few of the most common faults include:

causing the ball to touch the ground or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;
catching and throwing the ball;
double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player;
four consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same team;
net foul: touching the net during play;
foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.The ball is usually played with the hands or arms, but players can legally strike or push (short contact) the ball with any part of the body."
"A number of consistent techniques have evolved in volleyball, including spiking and blocking (because these plays are made above the top of the net, the vertical jump is an athletic skill emphasized in the sport) as well as passing, setting, and specialized player positions and offensive and defensive structures."
"The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945, respectively."
"The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict."
"In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland."
This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign that devastated 67 Japanese cities.
"The war in Europe concluded when Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War."
"By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: ""Fat Man"", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon; and ""Little Boy"", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon."
"The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces  was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands."
"The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on 26 July 1945, the alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction""."
Japan ignored the ultimatum.
"The consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the Quebec Agreement, and orders were issued on 25 July by General Thomas Handy, the acting  Chief of Staff of the United States Army, for atomic bombs to be used against Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki."
These targets were chosen because they were large urban areas that also held militarily significant facilities.
"On 6 August, a Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima, to which Prime Minister Suzuki reiterated the Japanese government's commitment to ignore the Allies' demands and fight on."
"Three days later, a Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki."
"Over the next two to four months, the effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on the first day."
"For months afterward, large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition."
"Most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison."
"Japan surrendered to the Allies on 15 August, six days after the Soviet Union's declaration of war and the bombing of Nagasaki."
"The Japanese government signed the instrument of surrender on 2 September, effectively ending the war."
"Scholars have extensively studied the effects of the bombings on the social and political character of subsequent world history and popular culture, and there is still much debate concerning the ethical and legal justification for the bombings."
"Supporters believe that the atomic bombings were necessary to bring a swift end to the war with minimal casualties, while critics dispute how the Japanese government was brought to surrender, while highlighting the moral and ethical implications of nuclear weapons and the deaths caused to civilians."
"A pipefitter or steamfitter is a tradesperson who installs, assembles, fabricates, maintains, and repairs mechanical piping systems."
Pipefitters usually begin as helpers or apprentices.
Journeyman pipefitters deal with industrial/commercial/marine piping and heating/cooling systems.
"Typical industrial process pipe is under high pressure, which requires metals such as carbon steel, stainless steel, and many different alloy metals fused together through precise cutting, threading, grooving, bending, and welding."
"A plumber concentrates on lower pressure piping systems for sewage and potable tap water in the industrial, commercial, institutional, or residential atmosphere."
"Utility piping typically consists of copper, PVC, CPVC, polyethylene, and galvanized pipe, which is typically glued, soldered, or threaded."
"Other types of piping systems include steam, ventilation, hydraulics, chemicals, fuel, and oil.In Canada, pipefitting is classified as a compulsory trade, and carries a voluntary ""red seal"" inter-provincial standards endorsement."
"Pipefitter apprenticeships are controlled and regulated provincially, and in some cases allow for advance standing in similar trades upon completion."
"In the United States, many states require pipefitters to be licensed."
"Requirements differ from state to state, but most include a four- to five-year apprenticeship."
"Union pipefitters are required to pass an apprenticeship test (often called a ""turn-out exam"") before becoming a licensed journeyman."
Others can be certified by NCCER (formerly the National Center for Construction Education and Research).
"Depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR, DPD) is a mental disorder in which the person has persistent or recurrent feelings of depersonalization or derealization."
Depersonalization is described as feeling disconnected or detached from one's self.
"Individuals may report feeling as if they are an outside observer of their own thoughts or body, and often report feeling a loss of control over their thoughts or actions."
Derealization is described as detachment from one's surroundings.
"Individuals experiencing derealization may report perceiving the world around them as foggy, dreamlike/surreal, or visually distorted.Depersonalization-derealization disorder is thought to be caused largely by interpersonal trauma such as childhood abuse."
"Adverse early childhood experiences, specifically emotional abuse and neglect have been linked to the development of depersonalization symptoms."
"Triggers may include significant stress, panic attacks, and drug use."
Those who do have this disorder could be in a depersonalized state for as long as a regular panic attack lasts.
"However, in some certain situations this state of mind could last either hours, days, and possibly even weeks at a time.Diagnostic criteria for depersonalization-derealization disorder includes persistent or recurrent feelings of detachment from one's mental or bodily processes or from one's surroundings."
"A diagnosis is made when the dissociation is persistent and interferes with the social or occupational functions of daily life.While depersonalization-derealization disorder was once considered rare, lifetime experiences with it occur in about 1–2% of the general population."
The chronic form of the disorder has a reported prevalence of 0.8 to 1.9%.
"While brief episodes of depersonalization or derealization can be common in the general population, the disorder is only diagnosed when these symptoms cause substantial distress or impair social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning."
A drawer  (listen) DROR is a box-shaped container inside a piece of furniture that can be pulled out horizontally to access its contents.
"Drawers are built into numerous types of furniture, including cabinets, chests of drawers (bureaus), desks, and the like."
The durian () is the edible fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio.
"There are 30 recognised Durio species, native to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand; at least nine of which produce edible fruit."
"Durio zibethinus, native to Borneo and Sumatra, is the only species available in the international market."
"It has over 300 named varieties in Thailand and 100 in Malaysia, as of 1987."
"Other species are sold in their local regions.Named in some regions as the ""king of fruits"", the durian is distinctive for its large size, strong odour, and thorn-covered rind."
"The fruit can grow as large as 30 centimetres (12 inches) long and 15 cm (6 in) in diameter, and it typically weighs 1 to 3 kilograms (2 to 7 pounds)."
"Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale yellow to red, depending on the species."
"Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance, whereas others find the aroma overpowering and unpleasant."
"The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, turpentine, and raw sewage."
"The persistence of its odour, which may linger for several days, led certain hotels and public transportation services in Southeast Asia to ban the fruit."
"However, the nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace described its flesh as ""a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds""."
"The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and it is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet desserts in Southeast Asian cuisines."
The seeds can also be eaten when cooked.
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."
"A guide is a person who leads travelers, sportsmen, or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations."
The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.
"Behavior (American English) or behaviour is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems or artificial entities in within some environment."
These systems can include other systems or organisms as well as the inanimate physical environment.
"It is the computed response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.Taking a behavior informatics perspective, a behavior consists of actor, operation, interactions, and their properties."
This can be represented as a behavior vector.
"Flyleaf is an American rock band formed in Belton, Texas, in 2002."
"The band has charted on mainstream rock, Christian pop and Christian metal genres."
"They performed around the United States in 2003 before releasing their eponymous debut album, Flyleaf, in 2005."
The album went platinum after selling more than one million copies.
"Flyleaf released their second album Memento Mori on November 10, 2009; it debuted and peaked at No."
8 on the Billboard charts.
"Flyleaf's third album New Horizons was released on October 30, 2012."
"Shortly before the album's release, lead vocalist Lacey Sturm announced her departure."
Kristen May subsequently became the new lead vocalist.
"May sang with the band until August 2016, when she announced her departure from the band."
A crayon (or wax pastel) is a stick of pigmented wax used for writing or drawing.
"Wax crayons differ from pastels, in which the pigment is mixed with a dry binder such as gum arabic, and from oil pastels, where the binder is a mixture of wax and oil."
"Crayons are available in a range of prices, and are easy to work with."
"They are less messy than most paints and markers, blunt (removing the risk of sharp points present when using a pencil or pen), typically non-toxic, and available in a wide variety of colors."
These characteristics make them particularly good instruments for teaching small children to draw in addition to being used widely by student and professional artists.
"The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning ""large foot"")."
"In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo."
Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.
"The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.As with the terms ""wallaroo"" and ""wallaby"", ""kangaroo"" refers to a paraphyletic grouping of species."
"All three refer to members of the same taxonomic family, Macropodidae, and are distinguished according to size."
"The largest species in the family are called ""kangaroos"" and the smallest are generally called ""wallabies""."
"The term ""wallaroos"" refers to species of an intermediate size."
"There are also the tree-kangaroos, another type of macropod, which inhabit the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, far northeastern Queensland and some of the islands in the region."
This kind of kangaroo lives in the upper branches of trees.
"A general idea of the relative size of these informal terms could be:

wallabies: head and body length of 45–105 cm and tail length of 33–75 cm; the dwarf wallaby (the smallest of all known macropod species) is 46 cm long and weighs 1.6 kg;
tree-kangaroos: ranging from Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo: body and head length of 48–65 cm, tail of 60–74 cm, weight of 7.2 kg (16 lb) for males and 5.9 kg (13 lb) for females; to the grizzled tree-kangaroo: length of 75–90 cm (30 to 35 in) and weight of 8–15 kg (18–33 lb);
wallaroos: the black wallaroo (the smallest of the two species) with a tail length of 60–70 cm and weight of 19–22 kg (41.8–48.5 lb) for males and 13 kg (28.6 lb) for females;
kangaroos: a large male can be 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb).Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head."
"Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development."
"Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth that are rare among mammals."
Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass.
"Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite."
"The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are replaced by new teeth that grow in the back."
"This process is known as polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees."
The large kangaroos have adapted much better than the smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans.
"Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, while kangaroos are relatively plentiful."
"The kangaroo is a symbol of Australia, appears on the Australian coat of arms and on some of its currency, and is used as a logo for some of Australia's most well-known organisations, such as Qantas, and as the roundel of the Royal Australian Air Force."
"The kangaroo is important to both Australian culture and the national image, and consequently there are numerous popular culture references."
"Wild kangaroos are shot for meat, leather hides, and to protect grazing land."
Kangaroo meat has perceived health benefits for human consumption compared with traditional meats due to the low level of fat on kangaroos.
"Laughter is a pleasant physical reaction consisting usually of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system."
It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli.
"Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts."
"Most commonly, it is considered an auditory expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, or relief."
"On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, surprise, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh."
"Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all indicators as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation."
"Some other species of primate (chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) show laughter-like vocalizations in response to physical contact such as wrestling, play chasing or tickling."
"Laughter is a part of human behavior regulated by the brain, helping humans clarify their intentions in social interaction and providing an emotional context to conversations."
Laughter is used as a signal for being part of a group—it signals acceptance and positive interactions with others.
"Laughter is sometimes seen as contagious, and the laughter of one person can itself provoke laughter from others as a positive feedback.The study of humor and laughter, and its psychological and physiological effects on the human body, is called gelotology."
Wales (Welsh: Cymru [ˈkəm.rɨ] (listen)) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.
"It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south."
"It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of 20,779 km2 (8,023 sq mi)."
"Wales has over 1,680 miles (2,700 km) of coastline and is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit."
"The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate."
"Welsh national identity emerged among the Britons after the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, and Wales is regarded as one of the modern Celtic nations."
"Llywelyn ap Gruffudd's death in 1282 marked the completion of Edward I of England's conquest of Wales, though Owain Glyndŵr briefly restored independence to Wales in the early 15th century."
The whole of Wales was annexed by England and incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542.
Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century.
"Welsh Liberalism, exemplified in the early 20th century by David Lloyd George, was displaced by the growth of socialism and the Labour Party."
"Welsh national feeling grew over the century; a nationalist party, Plaid Cymru was formed in 1925, and the Welsh Language Society in 1962."
"Established under the Government of Wales Act 1998, the Senedd (the Welsh Parliament, formerly known as the National Assembly for Wales) is responsible for a range of devolved policy matters."
"At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, development of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an agricultural society into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population."
"Two-thirds of the population live in South Wales, including the capital Cardiff along with Swansea, Newport and the nearby valleys."
The eastern region of North Wales has about a sixth of the overall population with Wrexham being the largest northern town.
The remaining parts of Wales are sparsely populated.
"Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, the economy is based on the public sector, light and service industries, and tourism."
"In livestock farming, including dairy farming, Wales is a net exporter, contributing towards national agricultural self-sufficiency."
"Wales closely shares its political and social history with the rest of Great Britain, and a majority of the population in most areas speaks English as a first language, but the country has retained a distinct cultural identity."
"Both Welsh and English are official languages; over 560,000 Welsh-speakers live in Wales, and the language is spoken by a majority of the population in parts of the north and west."
"From the late 19th century onwards, Wales acquired its popular image as the ""land of song"", in part due to the eisteddfod tradition."
"At many international sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup and the Commonwealth Games, Wales has its own national team."
"At the Olympic Games, Welsh athletes compete for the UK as part of a Great Britain team."
Rugby union is seen as a symbol of Welsh identity and an expression of national consciousness.
"A sailfish is a fish of the genus Istiophorus of billfish living in colder areas of all Earth's seas, which holds the record for the fastest speed of any of Earth's marine animals."
"They are predominantly blue to gray in colour and have a characteristic dorsal fin known as a sail, which often stretches the entire length of the back."
"Another notable characteristic is the elongated bill, resembling that of the swordfish and other marlins."
"They are, therefore, described as billfish in sport-fishing circles."
"A consumer is a person or a group who intends to order, orders, or uses purchased goods, products, or services primarily for personal, social, family, household and similar needs, not directly related to entrepreneurial or business activities."
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50.
Tin is a silvery-colored metal that characteristically has a faint yellow hue.
Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort.
"When bent, the so-called “tin cry” can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state."
Pure tin after solidifying presents a mirror-like appearance similar to most metals.
In most tin alloys (such as pewter) the metal solidifies with a dull gray color.
Tin is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements.
"It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains stannic oxide, SnO2."
"Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4."
"Tin is the 49th most abundant element on Earth and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons."
"It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is β-tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal; at low temperatures it is less dense grey α-tin, which has the diamond cubic structure."
Metallic tin does not easily oxidize in air and water.
"The first tin alloy used on a large scale was bronze, made of 1⁄8 tin and 7⁄8 copper, from as early as 3000 BC."
"After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced."
"Pewter, which is an alloy of 85–90% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony, bismuth, and sometimes lead and silver, has been used for flatware since the Bronze Age."
"In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin / lead soft solders, which are typically 60% or more tin, and in the manufacture of transparent, electrically conducting films of indium tin oxide in optoelectronic applications."
Another large application is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel.
"Because of the low toxicity of inorganic tin, tin-plated steel is widely used for food packaging as tin cans."
Some organotin compounds can be extremely toxic.
Wealth is the abundance of valuable financial assets or physical possessions which can be converted into a form that can be used for transactions.
"This includes the core meaning as held in the originating Old English word weal, which is from an Indo-European word stem."
"The modern concept of wealth is of significance in all areas of economics, and clearly so for growth economics and development economics, yet the meaning of wealth is context-dependent."
An individual possessing a substantial net worth is known as wealthy.
"Net worth is defined as the current value of one's assets less liabilities (excluding the principal in trust accounts).At the most general level, economists may define wealth as ""anything of value"" that captures both the subjective nature of the idea and the idea that it is not a fixed or static concept."
Various definitions and concepts of wealth have been asserted by various individuals and in different contexts.
"Defining wealth can be a normative process with various ethical implications, since often wealth maximization is seen as a goal or is thought to be a normative principle of its own."
"A community, region or country that possesses an abundance of such possessions or resources to the benefit of the common good is known as wealthy."
"The United Nations definition of inclusive wealth is a monetary measure which includes the sum of natural, human, and physical assets."
"Natural capital includes land, forests, energy resources, and minerals."
Human capital is the population's education and skills.
"Physical (or ""manufactured"") capital includes such things as machinery, buildings, and infrastructure."
"History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning ""inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation"") is the study and the documentation of the past."
Events before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
"""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events."
"Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect."
"Historians  often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
"Historians also debate the nature of history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give perspective on the problems of the present.Stories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends."
History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
"However, ancient cultural influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian, is often considered the ""father of history"" in the Western tradition, although he has also been criticized as the ""father of lies""."
"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies."
"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was reputed to date from as early as 722 BC, although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
"Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)."
Investors are repaid from the principal and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed through the capital structure of the new financing.
"Securities backed by mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS)."
The granularity of pools of securitized assets can mitigate the credit risk of individual borrowers.
"Unlike general corporate debt, the credit quality of securitized debt is non-stationary due to changes in volatility that are time- and structure-dependent."
"If the transaction is properly structured and the pool performs as expected, the credit risk of all tranches of structured debt improves; if improperly structured, the affected tranches may experience dramatic credit deterioration and loss.Securitization has evolved from its beginnings in the late 18th century to an estimated outstanding of $10.24 trillion in the United States and $2.25 trillion in Europe as of the 2nd quarter of 2008."
"In 2007, ABS issuance amounted to $3.455 trillion in the US and $652 billion in Europe."
"WBS (Whole Business Securitization) arrangements first appeared in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, and became common in various Commonwealth legal systems where senior creditors of an insolvent business effectively gain the right to control the company."
"Canvas is an extremely durable plain-woven fabric used for making sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, shelters, as a support for oil painting and for other items for which sturdiness is required, as well as in such fashion objects as handbags, electronic device cases, and shoes."
"It is also popularly used by artists as a painting surface, typically stretched across a wooden frame."
"Modern canvas is usually made of cotton or linen, or sometimes polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although historically it was made from hemp."
"It differs from other heavy cotton fabrics, such as denim, in being plain weave rather than twill weave."
Canvas comes in two basic types: plain and duck.
The threads in duck canvas are more tightly woven.
"The term duck comes from the Dutch word for cloth, doek."
"In the United States, canvas is classified in two ways: by weight (ounces per square yard) and by a graded number system."
The numbers run in reverse of the weight so a number 10 canvas is lighter than number 4.
"Canvas has become the most common support medium for oil painting, replacing wooden panels."
"It was used from the 14th century in Italy, but only rarely."
"One of the earliest surviving oils on canvas is a French Madonna with angels from around 1410 in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin."
"The word ""canvas"" is derived from the 13th century Anglo-French canevaz and the Old French canevas."
"Both may be derivatives of the Vulgar Latin cannapaceus for ""made of hemp"", originating from the Greek κάνναβις (cannabis)."
"A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed  to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other utilitarian work."
"Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle."
Smaller varieties may be mechanically similar to some automobiles.
"Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction excavators."
"In American English, a commercial vehicle without a trailer or other articulation is formally a ""straight truck"" while one designed specifically to pull a trailer is not a truck but a ""tractor"".The majority of trucks currently in use are still powered by diesel engines, although small- to medium-size trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US, Canada, and Mexico."
"The market-share of electrically-powered trucks is growing rapidly, expected to reach 7% globally by 2027, and electric motive force already predominates among both the largest and smallest trucks."
"In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3.5 t (3.4 long tons; 3.9 short tons) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those over as large goods vehicles."
"A changing room, locker room, dressing room (usually in a sports, theater or staff context) or changeroom (regional use) is a room or area designated for changing one's clothes."
Changing rooms are provided in a semi-public situation to enable people to change clothes with varying degrees of privacy.
"Separate changing rooms may be provided for men and women, or there may be a non-gender-specific open space with individual cubicles or stalls, as with unisex public toilets."
"Many changing rooms include toilets, sinks and showers."
Sometimes a changing room exists as a small portion of a restroom/washroom.
"For example, the men's and women's washrooms in Toronto's Dundas Square (which includes a water play area) each include a change area which is a blank counter space at the end of a row of sinks."
"In this case, the facility is primarily a washroom, and its use as a changing room is minimal, since only a small percentage of users change into bathing suits."
Sometimes a person may change their clothes in a toilet cubicle of a washroom.
"Larger changing rooms are usually found at public beaches, or other bathing areas, where most of the space is for changing, and minimal washroom space is included."
Beach-style changing rooms are often large open rooms with benches against the walls.
"Some do not have a roof, providing just the barrier necessary to prevent people outside from seeing in."
Chess is a board game played between two players.
"It is sometimes called Western chess, or International chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi."
"The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin."
"Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide."
Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
"At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns."
"The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ""check"") and there is no way for it to escape."
There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
Organized chess arose in the 19th century.
Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation).
"The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion."
A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
"Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology."
One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.
"In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov."
"Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory."
Rain is liquid water in the form of droplets that have condensed from atmospheric water vapor and then become heavy enough to fall under gravity.
Rain is a major component of the water cycle and is responsible for depositing most of the fresh water on the Earth.
"It provides suitable conditions for many types of ecosystems, as well as water for hydroelectric power plants and crop irrigation."
The major cause of rain production is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts.
"If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands."
"In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall along the sides of mountains."
"On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass."
"The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes."
"The urban heat island effect leads to increased rainfall, both in amounts and intensity, downwind of cities."
"Global warming is also causing changes in the precipitation pattern globally, including wetter conditions across eastern North America and drier conditions in the tropics."
Antarctica is the driest continent.
"The globally averaged annual precipitation over land is 715 mm (28.1 in), but over the whole Earth it is much higher at 990 mm (39 in)."
Climate classification systems such as the Köppen classification system use average annual rainfall to help differentiate between differing climate regimes.
Rainfall is measured using rain gauges.
Rainfall amounts can be estimated by weather radar.
"Rain is also known or suspected on other planets, where it may be composed of methane, neon, sulfuric acid, or even iron rather than water."
"Downtown is a term primarily used in North America by English speakers to refer to a city's sometimes commercial, cultural and often the historical, political and geographic heart."
It is often synonymous with its central business district (CBD).
Downtowns typically contain a small percentage of a city’s employment.
"In some metropolitan areas it is marked by a cluster of tall buildings, cultural institutions and the convergence of rail transit and bus lines."
"In British English, the term ""city centre"" is most often used instead."
Hydrogen is the chemical element with the symbol H and atomic number 1.
Hydrogen is the lightest element.
At standard conditions hydrogen is a gas of diatomic molecules having the formula H2.
"It is colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, and highly combustible."
"Hydrogen is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe, constituting roughly 75% of all normal matter."
Stars such as the Sun are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state.
Most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as water and organic compounds.
"For the most common isotope of hydrogen (symbol 1H) each atom has one proton, one electron, and no neutrons."
"In the early universe, the formation of protons, the nuclei of hydrogen, occurred during the first second after the Big Bang."
"The emergence of neutral hydrogen atoms throughout the universe occurred about 370,000 years later during the recombination epoch, when the plasma had cooled enough for electrons to remain bound to protons.Hydrogen is nonmetallic, except at extremely high pressures, and readily forms a single covalent bond with most nonmetallic elements, forming compounds such as water and nearly all organic compounds."
Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions because these reactions usually involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules.
"In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) where it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+."
The H+ cation is simply a proton (symbol p) but its behavior in aqueous solutions and in ionic compounds involves screening of its electric charge by nearby polar molecules or anions.
"Because hydrogen is the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, the study of its energetics and chemical bonding has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics."
Hydrogen gas was first artificially produced in the early 16th century by the reaction of acids on metals.
"In 1766–1781, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, the property for which it was later named: in Greek, hydrogen means ""water-former""."
"Industrial production is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more energy-intensive methods such as the electrolysis of water."
"Most hydrogen is used near the site of its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market."
"Hydrogen is problematic in metallurgy because it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight."
"The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning ""to pull, to draw""."
"Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as ""engines""), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units."
"Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons."
"Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails."
"Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport."
"Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables."
"Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before."
Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
"Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power."
"Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned."
The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.
"Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport."
"High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances."
"Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century."
"Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks."
"While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation."
"Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes."
"Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains."
Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.
"A holiday is a day set aside by custom or by law on which normal activities, especially business or work including school, are suspended or reduced."
"Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance."
"Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations."
"The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices."
The concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances or associated with traditions.
The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar.
"In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational functions as any other weekend days or activities."
"In many societies, there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions."
"For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith."
"In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed."
"For example, many people in England treat Bank Holiday as a ""working holiday"", changing very little of their daily routines for this day."
The word holiday has differing connotations in different regions.
"In the United States the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed day(s) of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations, the word may refer to the period of time where leave from one's duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred vacation."
"This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences."
The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws.
"Employers and educational institutes may designate ‘holidays’ themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with."
A brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals.
"It is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision."
It is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.
"In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14–16 billion neurons, and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion."
Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons.
"These neurons typically communicate with one another by means of long fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells."
"Physiologically, brains exert centralized control over a body's other organs."
They act on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones.
This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment.
"Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain."
The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved.
"Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological computer, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways."
"This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates."
It deals with the human brain insofar as it shares the properties of other brains.
The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article.
Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context.
"The most important is brain disease and the effects of brain damage, that are covered in the human brain article."
"The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract, including talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, humming or yelling."
The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source.
"(Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.)"
"Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx (voice box), and the articulators."
"The lungs, the ""pump"" must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds."
The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.
The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to 'fine-tune' pitch and tone.
"The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc.)"
articulate and filter the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen or weaken it as a sound source.
"The vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate arrays of sound."
"The tone of voice may be modulated to suggest emotions such as anger, surprise, fear, happiness or sadness."
"The human voice is used to express emotion, and can also reveal the age and sex of the speaker."
Singers use the human voice as an instrument for creating music.
"A barrel or cask is a hollow cylindrical container with a bulging center, longer than it is wide."
They are traditionally made of wooden staves and bound by wooden or metal hoops.
"The word vat is often used for large containers for liquids, usually alcoholic beverages; a small barrel or cask is known as a keg.Modern wooden barrels for wine-making are made of French common oak (Quercus robur), white oak (Quercus petraea), or American white oak (Quercus alba) and typically have standard sizes:

""Bordeaux type"" 225 litres (59 US gal; 49 imp gal),
""Burgundy type"" 228 litres (60 US gal; 50 imp gal) and
""Cognac type"" 300 litres (79 US gal; 66 imp gal).Modern barrels and casks can also be made of aluminum, stainless steel, and different types of plastic, such as HDPE."
"Someone who makes barrels is called a ""barrel maker"" or cooper (coopers also make buckets, vats, tubs, butter churns, hogsheads, firkins, kegs, kilderkins, tierces, rundlets, puncheons, pipes, tuns, butts, pins, troughs and breakers)."
"Barrels have a variety of uses, including storage of liquids such as water, oil, and alcohol arrack, and sake."
"They are also employed to hold maturing beverages such as wine, cognac, armagnac, sherry, port, whiskey, and beer."
"Other commodities once stored in wooden casks include gunpowder, meat, fish, paint, honey, nails and tallow."
"Early casks were bound with wooden hoops and in the 19th century these were gradually replaced by metal hoops that were stronger, more durable and took up less space."
"The term barrel can also refer to roughly cylindrical containers or drums made of modern materials like plastic, steel or aluminium."
The barrel has also been used as a standard size of measure referring to a set capacity or weight of a given commodity.
"For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imperial gallons (160 L; 43 US gal)."
Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 litres (31 US gal; 26 imp gal).
"A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels."
The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size.
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries).
"It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation."
"It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings."
"These are principles of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.Although procedures vary from one field of inquiry to another, the underlying process is frequently the same from one field to another."
"The process in the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions."
"A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question."
"The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad."
Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies.
"A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations  agree with or conflict with the expectations deduced from a hypothesis."
": Book I, [6.54] pp.372, 408  Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's Large Hadron Collider."
"There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however."
"Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles."
"Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order."
"Sweatsuit is a compilation album by American rapper Nelly, released on November 22, 2005."
"The album consists of tracks from his 2004 simultaneous album releases, Sweat and Suit."
"The US edition of the compilation also includes four extra tracks, including the single ""Grillz"" featuring rappers Paul Wall and Ali & Gipp, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart; along with The Notorious B.I.G."
"single ""Nasty Girl"", ""Tired"" featuring Avery Storm, and ""Fly Away"" from the soundtrack of the 2005 film The Longest Yard."
"Sweatsuit received positive reviews from critics, for containing the highlights from both Sweat and Suit, praising its material quality."
"Commercially, the compilation peaked at 26 on the US Billboard 200, and reached the top 40 in Australia and New Zealand."
"It has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of 500,000 copies."
"Myles Standish (c. 1584 – October 3, 1656) was an English military officer."
"He was hired as military adviser for Plymouth Colony in present-day Massachusetts, United States by the Pilgrims."
Standish accompanied the Pilgrims on the ship Mayflower and played a leading role in the administration and defense of Plymouth Colony from its foundation in 1620.
"On February 17, 1621, the Plymouth Colony militia elected him as its first commander and continued to re-elect him to that position for the remainder of his life."
"Standish served at various times as an agent of Plymouth Colony on a return trip to England, as assistant governor of the colony, and as its treasurer.A defining characteristic of Standish's military leadership was his proclivity for preemptive action."
He led at least two attacks or small skirmishes against Native Americans in a raid on the village of Nemasket and a conflict at Wessagusset Colony.
"During these actions, Standish exhibited courage and skill as a soldier, but he also demonstrated a brutality that angered the Natives and disturbed more moderate members of the colony.Standish led a botched expedition against French troops at Penobscot in 1635, one of his last military actions."
"By the 1640s, he relinquished his role as an active soldier and became a farmer in Duxbury, Massachusetts, where he was one of the first settlers."
"He remained nominal commander of the Pilgrim military forces in the growing colony, but acted in an advisory capacity."
He died in his home in Duxbury in 1656 at age 72.
"Standish supported and defended the Pilgrims' colony for much of his life, though there is no evidence to suggest that he ever joined their church.Several towns and military installations have been named after Standish, and monuments have been built in his memory."
"He appears as lead character in the 1858 poem The Courtship of Miles Standish by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, a highly fictionalized account which presents him as a timid romantic."
The poem was popular in the 19th century and played a role in cementing the Pilgrim story in American culture.
"A crown is a traditional form of head adornment, or hat, worn by monarchs as a symbol of their power and dignity."
"A crown is often, by extension, a symbol of the monarch's government or items endorsed by it."
"The word itself is used, particularly in Commonwealth countries, as an abstract name for the monarchy itself, as distinct from the individual who inhabits it (see The Crown)."
A specific type of crown (or coronet for lower ranks of peerage) is employed in heraldry under strict rules.
"Indeed, some monarchies never had a physical crown, just a heraldic representation, as in the constitutional kingdom of Belgium, where no coronation ever took place; the royal installation is done by a solemn oath in parliament, wearing a military uniform: the King is not acknowledged as by divine right, but assumes the only hereditary public office in the service of the law; so he in turn will swear in all members of ""his"" federal government."
"""The Tortoise and the Hare"" is one of Aesop's Fables and is numbered 226 in the Perry Index."
The account of a race between unequal partners has attracted conflicting interpretations.
The fable itself is a variant of a common folktale theme in which ingenuity and trickery (rather than doggedness) are employed to overcome a stronger opponent.
A shoe is an item of footwear intended to protect and comfort the human foot.
Shoes are also used as an item of decoration and fashion.
"The design of shoes has varied enormously through time and from culture to culture, with form originally being tied to function."
"Though the human foot can adapt to varied terrains and climate conditions, it is still vulnerable to environmental hazards such as sharp rocks and temperature extremes, which shoes protect against."
"Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are required footwear at industrial worksites."
"Additionally, fashion has often dictated many design elements, such as whether shoes have very high heels or flat ones."
"Contemporary footwear varies widely in style, complexity and cost."
Basic sandals may consist of only a thin sole and simple strap and be sold for a low cost.
"High fashion shoes made by famous designers may be made of expensive materials, use complex construction and sell for large sums of money."
"Some shoes are designed for specific purposes, such as boots designed specifically for mountaineering or skiing, while others have more generalized usage such as sneakers which have transformed from a special purpose sport shoe into a general use shoe."
"Traditionally, shoes have been made from leather, wood or canvas, but are increasingly being made from rubber, plastics, and other petrochemical-derived materials."
"Globally, the shoe industry is a $200 billion a year industry."
"90% of shoes end up in landfills, because the materials are hard to separate, recycle or otherwise reuse."
"A port is a maritime facility comprising one or more wharves or loading areas, where ships load and discharge cargo and passengers."
"Although usually situated on a sea coast or estuary, ports can also be found far inland, such as Hamburg, Manchester and Duluth; these access the sea via rivers or canals."
"Because of their roles as ports of entry for immigrants as well as soldiers in wartime, many port cities have experienced dramatic multi-ethnic and multicultural changes throughout their respective histories.Ports are extremely important to the global economy; 70% of global merchandise trade by value passes through a port."
"For this reason, ports are also often densely populated settlements that provide the labor for processing and handling goods and related services for the ports."
"Today by far the greatest growth in port development is in Asia, the continent with some of the world's largest and busiest ports, such as Singapore and the Chinese ports of Shanghai and Ningbo-Zhoushan."
"As of 2020, the busiest passenger port in Europe is the Port of Helsinki in Finland."
"Nevertheless, countless smaller ports do exist that may only serve their local tourism or fishing industries."
"Ports can have a wide environmental impact on local ecologies and waterways, most importantly water quality, which can be caused by dredging, spills and other pollution."
Ports are heavily affected by changing environmental factors caused by climate change as most port infrastructure is extremely vulnerable to sea level rise and coastal flooding.
"Internationally, global ports are beginning to identify ways to improve coastal management practices and integrate climate change adaptation practices into their construction."
"In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae."
It contains the pharynx and larynx.
"An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs."
"The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords."
"Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle."
"The ""throat"" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces.It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body."
"Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat."
"It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube."
The throat's trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs.
The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach.
Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue.
"The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat."
"The Jugulum is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast."
"The term Jugulum is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the Jugulum."
The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera.
It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside.
"An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar."
"It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring."
"Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own."
"The tiger was first scientifically described in 1758 and once ranged widely from the Eastern Anatolia Region in the west to the Amur River basin in the east, and in the south from the foothills of the Himalayas to Bali in the Sunda Islands."
"Since the early 20th century, tiger populations have lost at least 93% of their historic range and have been extirpated from Western and Central Asia, the islands of Java and Bali, and in large areas of Southeast and South Asia and China."
"Today, the tiger's range is fragmented, stretching from Siberian temperate forests to subtropical and tropical forests on the Indian subcontinent, Indochina and Sumatra."
The tiger is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.
"As of 2015, the global wild tiger population was estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 mature individuals, with most of the populations living in small isolated pockets."
India currently hosts the largest tiger population.
"Major reasons for population decline are habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching."
"Tigers are also victims of human–wildlife conflict, particularly in range countries with a high human population density."
The tiger is among the most recognisable and popular of the world's charismatic megafauna.
"It featured prominently in the ancient mythology and folklore of cultures throughout its historic range, and continues to be depicted in modern films and literature, appearing on many flags, coats of arms and as mascots for sporting teams."
"The tiger is the national animal of India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and South Korea."
"A claw is a curved, pointed appendage found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes (mammals, reptiles, birds)."
"Some invertebrates such as beetles and spiders have somewhat similar fine, hooked structures at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as they walk."
"The pincers of crabs, lobsters and scorpions, more formally known as their chelae, are sometimes called claws."
A true claw is made of a hard protein called keratin.
"Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs but may also be used for such purposes as digging, climbing trees, self-defense and grooming, in those and other species."
Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead.
Claw-like projections that do not form at the end of digits but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs.
"In  finance, an exchange rate is the rate at which one currency will be exchanged for another currency."
"Currencies are most commonly national currencies, but may be sub-national as in the case of Hong Kong or supra-national as in the case of the euro."
The exchange rate is also regarded as the value of one country's currency in relation to another currency.
"For example, an interbank exchange rate of 114 Japanese yen  to the United States dollar means that ¥114 will be exchanged for US$1 or that US$1 will be exchanged for ¥114."
"In this case it is said that the price of a dollar in relation to yen is ¥114, or equivalently that the price of a yen in relation to dollars is $1/114."
Each country determines the exchange rate regime that will apply to its currency.
"For example, a currency may be floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid."
Governments can impose certain limits and controls on exchange rates.
Countries can also have a strong or weak currency.
There is no agreement in the economic literature on the optimal national exchange rate (unlike on the subject of trade where free trade is considered optimal).
"Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations.In floating exchange rate regimes, exchange rates are  determined in the foreign exchange market, which is open to a wide range of different types of buyers and sellers, and where currency trading is continuous: 24 hours a day except weekends (i.e."
trading from 20:15 GMT on Sunday until 22:00 GMT Friday).
"The spot exchange rate is the current exchange rate, while the forward exchange rate is an exchange rate that is quoted and traded today but for delivery and payment on a specific future date."
"In the retail currency exchange market, different buying and selling rates will be quoted by money dealers."
Most trades are to or from the local currency.
"The buying rate is the rate at which money dealers will buy foreign currency, and the selling rate is the rate at which they will sell that currency."
"The quoted rates will incorporate an allowance for a dealer's margin (or profit) in trading, or else the margin may be recovered in the form of a commission or in some other way."
"Different rates may also be quoted for cash, a documentary transaction or for electronic transfers."
The higher rate on documentary transactions has been justified as compensating for the additional time and cost of clearing the document.
"On the other hand, cash is available for resale immediately, but incurs security, storage, and transportation costs, and the cost of tying up capital in a stock of banknotes (bills)."
"""Rocket 88"" (originally stylized as Rocket ""88"") is a rhythm and blues song that was first recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, in March 1951."
"The recording was credited to ""Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats"", who were actually Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm."
The single reached number-one on the Billboard R&B chart.
"Many music writers acknowledge its importance in the development of rock and roll music, with several considering it to be the first rock and roll record."
"In 2017, the Mississippi Blues Trail dedicated its 200th marker to ""Rocket 88"" as an influential record."
"The song was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1991, the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998,
and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018."
"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool."
"Games are different from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements."
"However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)."
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well."
"They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals."
"The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship."
"On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play."
"Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player."
A toy and a game are not the same.
Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction."
"Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both."
"Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role."
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures."
"The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games."
"A fairy (also fay, fae, fey, fair folk, or faerie) is a type of mythical being or legendary creature found in the folklore of multiple European cultures (including Celtic, Slavic, Germanic, English, and French folklore), a form of spirit, often described as metaphysical, supernatural, or preternatural."
"Myths and stories about fairies do not have a single origin, but are rather a collection of folk beliefs from disparate sources."
"Various folk theories about the origins of fairies include casting them as either demoted angels or demons in a Christian tradition, as deities in Pagan belief systems, as spirits of the dead, as prehistoric precursors to humans, or as spirits of nature."
"The label of fairy has at times applied only to specific magical creatures with human appearance, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery."
"At other times it has been used to describe any magical creature, such as goblins and gnomes."
"Fairy has at times been used as an adjective, with a meaning equivalent to ""enchanted"" or ""magical""."
"It is also used as a name for the place these beings come from, the land of Fairy."
A recurring motif of legends about fairies is the need to ward off fairies using protective charms.
"Common examples of such charms include church bells, wearing clothing inside out, four-leaf clover, and food."
"Fairies were also sometimes thought to haunt specific locations, and to lead travelers astray using will-o'-the-wisps."
"Before the advent of modern medicine, fairies were often blamed for sickness, particularly tuberculosis and birth deformities."
"In addition to their folkloric origins, fairies were a common feature of Renaissance literature and Romantic art, and were especially popular in the United Kingdom during the Victorian and Edwardian eras."
The Celtic Revival also saw fairies established as a canonical part of Celtic cultural heritage.
"The ( (listen)) is a grammatical article in English, denoting persons or things already mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers."
It is the definite article in English.
The is the most frequently used word in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words.
It is derived from gendered articles in Old English which combined in Middle English and now has a single form used with pronouns of any gender.
"The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter."
"This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers."
"A backhoe—also called rear actor or back actor—is a type of excavating equipment, or digger, consisting of a digging bucket on the end of a two-part articulated arm."
"It is typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader, the latter forming a ""backhoe loader"" (a US term, but known as a ""JCB"" in Ireland and the UK)."
"The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the boom, while the section that carries the bucket is known as the dipper (or dipper-stick), both terms derived from steam shovels."
"The boom is generally attached to the vehicle through a pivot known as the king-post, which allows the arm to pivot left and right, usually through a total of 180 to 200 degrees."
"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is a broad term used to group together these academic disciplines."
This term is typically used to address an education policy or curriculum choices in schools.
"It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns (as a shortage of STEM-educated citizens can reduce effectiveness in this area) and immigration policy.There is no universal agreement on which disciplines are included in STEM; in particular whether or not the science in STEM includes social sciences, such as psychology, sociology, economics, and political science."
"In the United States, these are typically included by organizations such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Labor's O*Net online database for job seekers, and the Department of Homeland Security."
"In the United Kingdom, the social sciences are categorized separately and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS (Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences), rebranded in the UK in 2020 as SHAPE."
"A bus (contracted from omnibus, with variants multibus, motorbus, autobus, etc.)"
is a public transport road vehicle designed to carry significantly more passengers than the average cars or vans.
"Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers, although the average bus usually carries between 30 to 100."
"The most common type is the single-deck rigid bus, with larger loads for double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads for midibuses and minibuses, while coaches are used for longer-distance services."
"Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare."
"Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus, do not charge a fare."
"In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special large vehicle licence above and beyond a regular driving licence."
"Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, or tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes, including rock and pop band tour vehicles."
"Horse-drawn buses were used from the 1820s, followed by steam buses in the 1830s, and electric trolleybuses in 1882."
"The first internal combustion engine buses, or motor buses, were used in 1895."
"Recently, interest has been growing in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, and electric buses, as well as buses powered by compressed natural gas or biodiesel."
"As of the 2010s, bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same designs appearing around the world."
"A baguette (; French: [baɡɛt] (listen)) is a long, thin type of bread of French origin that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law)."
It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.
"A baguette has a diameter of about 5 to 6 centimetres (2–2+1⁄2 inches) and a usual length of about 65 cm (26 in), although a baguette can be up to 1 m (39 in) long."
"In November 2018, documentation surrounding the ""craftsmanship and culture"" on making this bread was added to the French Ministry of Culture's National Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage."
"In May 2021, France submitted the baguette for UNESCO heritage status."
"Natural history is a domain of inquiry involving organisms, including animals, fungi, and plants, in their natural environment, leaning more towards observational than experimental methods of study."
A person who studies natural history is called a naturalist or natural historian.
Natural history encompasses scientific research but is not limited to it.
It involves the systematic study of any category of natural objects or organisms.
"So while it dates from studies in the ancient Greco-Roman world and the mediaeval Arabic world, through to European Renaissance naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a cross-discipline umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., geobiology has a strong multidisciplinary nature."
"Board games are tabletop games that typically use pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked board (playing surface) and often include elements of table, card, role-playing, and miniatures games as well."
Most feature a competition between two or more players.
"In checkers, a player wins by capturing all opposing pieces, while Eurogames often end with a calculation of final scores."
"Pandemic is a cooperative game where players all win or lose as a team, and peg solitaire is a puzzle for one person."
There are many varieties of board games.
"Their representation of real-life situations can range from having no inherent theme, such as checkers, to having a specific theme and narrative, such as Cluedo."
"Rules can range from the very simple, such as in Snakes and Ladders; to deeply complex, as in Advanced Squad Leader."
"The time required to learn to play or master a game varies greatly from game to game, but is not necessarily correlated with the number or complexity of rules; games like chess or Go possess relatively simple rulesets, but have great strategic depth."
A domestic worker is a person who works within the scope of a residence.
"The term ""domestic service"" applies to the equivalent occupational category."
"In traditional English contexts, such a person was said to be ""in service""."
"Domestic workers perform a variety of household services for an individual(s), from providing cleaning and household maintenance, or cooking, laundry and ironing, or care for children and elderly dependents, and other household errands."
Some domestic workers live within their employer's household.
"In some cases, the contribution and skill of servants whose work encompassed complex management tasks in large households have been highly valued."
"However, for the most part, domestic work tends to be demanding and is commonly considered to be undervalued, despite often being necessary."
"Although legislation protecting domestic workers is in place in many countries, it is often not extensively enforced."
"In many jurisdictions, domestic work is poorly regulated and domestic workers are subject to serious abuses, including slavery.Servant is an older English word for ""domestic worker"", though not all servants worked inside the home."
"Domestic service, or the employment of people for wages in their employer's residence, was sometimes simply called ""service"" and has often been part of a hierarchical system."
"In Britain a highly developed system of domestic service peaked towards the close of the Victorian era, perhaps reaching its most complicated and rigidly structured state during the Edwardian period (a period known in the United States as the Gilded Age and in France as the Belle Époque), which reflected the limited social mobility before World War I."
"Lilium parryi, common name lemon lily, is a rare species of lily.Lilium parryi is native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico where it grows in moist areas in mountain habitats."
In California it is currently known from the San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains and a few remaining spots near Palomar Mountain to the south.
"It is the only true lily native to  Arizona, where a few populations can be found in the Huachuca, Chiricahua, and Santa Rita Mountains."
"In Mexico, it has been found in mountains in the states of Sonora and Baja California.Lilium parryi is a perennial herb growing erect to about 2 meters in height from a scaly, elongated bulb up to 11 centimetres (4+1⁄3 in) long."
"The leaves are generally linear in shape, up to 29 centimetres (11+1⁄2 in) long, and usually arranged in whorls around the stem."
"The inflorescence is a raceme bearing up to 31 large, showy, bright lemon yellow flowers."
"The trumpet-shaped, fragrant flowers have six curling tepals up to 11 centimetres (4+1⁄3 in) long, sometimes with a few reddish spots."
There are six stamens tipped with large anthers up to 1.4 centimetres (1⁄2 in) long.
The pistil may be 10 centimetres (4 in) long.
"The flowers are pollinated by hawkmoths, especially Hyles lineata and Sphinx perelegans.Threats to this species include grazing, recreation, natural flooding and human alterations in water regimes, and horticultural collecting of the bulbs and flowers."
"Lilium parryi was named for Charles Christopher Parry (28 August 1823 – 20 February 1890), a British-American  botanist and mountaineer."
"Idyllwild, California, hosts the Lemon Lily Festival, which celebrates this species."
"The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder."
Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
"Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing."
"Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes."
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.
"Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order."
"In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property."
Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies.
"Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule."
"A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard."
"Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards."
"Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members."
The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.Numerous slang terms exist for the police.
Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies.
"One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession."
"A bell jar is a glass jar, similar in shape to a bell (i.e."
"in its best-known form it is open at the bottom, while its top and sides together are a single piece), and can be manufactured from a variety of materials (ranging from glass to different types of metals)."
Bell jars are often used in laboratories to form and contain a vacuum.
It is a common science apparatus used in experiments.
Bell jars have a limited ability to create strong vacuums; vacuum chambers are available when higher performance is needed.
They have been used to demonstrate the effect of vacuum on sound propagation.
"In addition to their scientific applications, bell jars may also serve as display cases or transparent dust covers."
In these situations the bell jar is not usually placed under vacuum.
A political party is an organization that coordinates candidates to compete in a particular country's elections.
"It is common for the members of a party to hold similar ideas about politics, and parties may promote specific ideological or policy goals."
"Political parties have become a major part of the politics of almost every country, as modern party organizations developed and spread around the world over the last few centuries."
It is extremely rare for a country to have no political parties.
Some countries have only one political party while others have several.
"Parties are important in the politics of autocracies as well as democracies, though usually democracies have more political parties than autocracies."
"Autocracies often have a single party that governs the country, and some political scientists consider competition between two or more parties to be an essential part of democracy."
"Parties can develop from existing divisions in society, like the divisions between lower and upper classes, and they streamline the process of making political decisions by encouraging their members to cooperate."
"Political parties usually include a party leader, who has primary responsibility for the activities of the party; party executives, who may select the leader and who perform administrative and organizational tasks; and party members, who may volunteer to help the party, donate money to it, and vote for its candidates."
There are many different ways in which political parties can be structured and interact with the electorate.
"The contributions that citizens give to political parties are often regulated by law, and parties will sometimes govern in a way that favours the people who donate time and money to them."
Many political parties are motivated by ideological goals.
"It is common for democratic elections to feature competitions between liberal, conservative, and socialist parties; other common ideologies of very large political parties include communism, populism, nationalism, and Islamism."
Political parties in different countries will often adopt similar colours and symbols to identify themselves with a particular ideology.
"However, many political parties have no ideological affiliation, and may instead be primarily engaged in patronage, clientelism, or the advancement of a specific political entrepreneur."
"In a building, a room is any space enclosed within a number of walls to which entry is possible only by a door or other dividing structure that connects it either to a passageway, to another room, or to the outdoors, that is large enough for several persons to move about, and whose size, fixtures, furnishings, and sometimes placement within the building support the activity to be conducted in it."
A woman is an adult female human.
"Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent)."
"The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as ""women's rights"" to denote female humans regardless of age."
"Typically, women have two X chromosomes and are capable of pregnancy and giving birth from puberty until menopause."
"Female anatomy is distinguished from male anatomy by the female reproductive system, which includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, and vulva."
"The adult female pelvis is wider, the hips broader, and the breasts larger than that of adult males."
"Women have significantly less facial and other body hair, have a higher body fat composition, and are on average shorter and less muscular than men."
"Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined and limited women's activities and opportunities; many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for women."
"With restrictions loosening during the 20th century in many societies, women have gained access to careers beyond the traditional homemaker, and the ability to pursue higher education."
"Violence against women, whether within families or in communities, has a long history and is primarily committed by men."
Some women are denied reproductive rights.
The movements and ideologies of feminism have a shared goal of achieving gender equality.
"Trans women develop a gender identity that does not align with their male sex assignment at birth, while intersex women may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of female biology."
Billionaire Boy is a children's fiction book written by David Walliams and illustrated by Tony Ross.
It was published on 28 October 2010 by HarperCollins.
"The story follows Joe Spud, who is the richest boy in the country and has everything he could ever want, other than a friend."
"The book was adapted for BBC television, broadcast on 1 January 2016."
"Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it is a business, a non-profit organization, or a government body."
It is the art and science of managing resources.
"Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees (or of volunteers) to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources."
"""Run the business"" and ""Change the business"" are two concepts that are used in management to differentiate between the continued delivery of goods or services and adapting of goods or services to meet the changing needs of customers - see trend."
"The term ""management"" may also refer to those people who manage an organization—managers."
Some people study management at colleges or universities; major degrees in management include the Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com.)
Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA.)
Master of Business Administration (MBA.)
"Master in Management (MSM or MIM) and, for the public sector, the Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree."
"Individuals who aim to become management specialists or experts, management researchers, or professors may complete the Doctor of Management (DM), the Doctor of Business Administration (DBA), or the Ph.D. in Business Administration or Management."
There has recently been a movement for evidence-based management.
"Larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure:

Senior managers, such as members of a board of directors and a chief executive officer (CEO) or a president of an organization."
They set the strategic goals of the organization and make decisions on how the overall organization will operate.
"Senior managers are generally executive-level professionals and provide direction to middle management, who directly or indirectly report to them."
"Middle managers: examples of these would include branch managers, regional managers, department managers, and section managers, who provide direction to front-line managers."
Middle managers communicate the strategic goals of senior management to the front-line managers.
"Lower managers, such as supervisors and front-line team leaders, oversee the work of regular employees (or volunteers, in some voluntary organizations) and provide direction on their work.In smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization."
"Social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization, organizational adaptation, and organizational leadership."
"A metal (from Greek μέταλλον métallon, ""mine, quarry, metal"") is a material that, when freshly prepared, polished, or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well."
Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires).
A metal may be a chemical element such as iron; an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as polymeric sulfur nitride.
"In physics, a metal is generally regarded as any substance capable of conducting electricity at a temperature of absolute zero."
Many elements and compounds that are not normally classified as metals become metallic under high pressures.
"For example, the nonmetal iodine gradually becomes a metal at a pressure of between 40 and 170 thousand times atmospheric pressure."
"Equally, some materials regarded as metals can become nonmetals."
"Sodium, for example, becomes a nonmetal at pressure of just under two million times atmospheric pressure."
"In chemistry, two elements that would otherwise qualify (in physics) as brittle metals—arsenic and antimony—are commonly instead recognised as metalloids due to their chemistry (predominantly non-metallic for arsenic, and balanced between metallicity and nonmetallicity for antimony)."
Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals (or are likely to be such).
"The number is inexact as the boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved."
"In astrophysics the term ""metal"" is cast more widely to refer to all chemical elements in a star that are heavier than helium, and not just traditional metals."
"In this sense the first four ""metals"" collecting in stellar cores through nucleosynthesis are carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon, all of which are strictly non-metals in chemistry."
"A star fuses lighter atoms, mostly hydrogen and helium, into heavier atoms over its lifetime."
"Used in that sense, the metallicity of an astronomical object is the proportion of its matter made up of the heavier chemical elements.Metals, as chemical elements, comprise 25% of the Earth's crust and are present in many aspects of modern life."
"The strength and resilience of some metals has led to their frequent use in, for example, high-rise building and bridge construction, as well as most vehicles, many home appliances, tools, pipes, and railroad tracks."
"Precious metals were historically used as coinage, but in the modern era, coinage metals have extended to at least 23 of the chemical elements.The history of refined metals is thought to begin with the use of copper about 11,000 years ago."
"Gold, silver, iron (as meteoric iron), lead, and brass were likewise in use before the first known appearance of bronze in the 5th millennium BCE."
"Subsequent developments include the production of early forms of steel; the discovery of sodium—the first light metal—in 1809; the rise of modern alloy steels; and, since the end of World War II, the development of more sophisticated alloys."
"A third baseman, abbreviated 3B, is the player in baseball or softball whose responsibility is to defend the area nearest to third base —  the third of four bases a baserunner must touch in succession to score a run."
"In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the third baseman is assigned the number '5'."
"The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as he is often the closest infielder (roughly 90–120 feet) to the batter."
"The third base position requires a strong and accurate arm, as the third baseman often makes long throws to first base."
The third baseman sometimes must throw quickly to second base in time to start a double play.
The third baseman must also field fly balls in fair and foul territories.
"Third base is known as the ""hot corner"", because the third baseman is relatively close to the batter and most right-handed hitters tend to hit the ball hard in this direction."
A third baseman must possess good hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard line drives sometimes in excess of 120 miles per hour (190 km/h).
"Third basemen often must begin in a position even closer to the batter if a bunt is expected, creating a hazard if the ball is instead hit sharply."
"As with middle infielders, right-handed throwing players are standard at the position because they do not need to turn their body before throwing across the infield to first base."
"Mike Squires, who played fourteen games at third base in 1982 and 1983, is a very rare example of a third baseman who threw lefty."
Some third basemen have been converted from middle infielders or outfielders because the position does not require them to run as fast.
"Expectations of how well a third baseman should be able to hit have varied a great deal over time; in the early years of the sport, these expectations were similar to those for shortstops, the third baseman being merely the less skilled defensive player."
"Players who could hit with more ability often were not suited for third base, either because they were left-handed or because they were not mobile enough for the position."
"However, the beginning of the live-ball era in the 1920s created a greater demand for more offense, and third basemen have since been expected to hit either for a high average (.290 or better) or with moderate to substantial power."
"Since the 1950s the position has become more of a power position with sluggers such as Eddie Mathews, Mike Schmidt and Ron Santo becoming stars."
There are fewer third basemen in the Baseball Hall of Fame than there are Hall of Famers of any other position.
"Furthermore, with the notable exception of John McGraw and Bobby Cox, few third basemen have gone on to have successful managing careers, with Jimmy Dykes and Negro leaguer Dave Malarcher being perhaps the next most prominent managers who began their careers at third base."
"Must (from the Latin vinum mustum, ""young wine"") is freshly crushed fruit juice (usually grape juice) that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit."
The solid portion of the must is called pomace and typically makes up 7–23% of the total weight of the must.
Making must is the first step in winemaking.
"Because of its high glucose content, typically between 10 and 15%, must is also used as a sweetener in a variety of cuisines."
"Unlike commercially sold grape juice, which is filtered and pasteurized, must is thick with particulate matter, opaque, and comes in various shades of brown and purple."
The vestibulospinal tract is a neural tract in the central nervous system.
"Specifically, it is a component of the extrapyramidal system and is classified as a component of the medial pathway."
"Like other descending motor pathways, the vestibulospinal fibers of the tract relay information from nuclei to motor neurons."
The vestibular nuclei receive information through the vestibulocochlear nerve about changes in the orientation of the head.
The nuclei relay motor commands through the vestibulospinal tract.
"The function of these motor commands is to alter muscle tone, extend, and change the position of the limbs and head with the goal of supporting posture and maintaining balance of the body and head."
"Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people, events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact."
"In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often specifically novels, as well as novellas and short stories."
"More broadly, however, fiction has come to encompass imaginary narratives expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing games, and video games."
Coller is a surname.
"Notable people with the surname include:

Amrose B. Coller (1885–1951), American politician
Jeremy Coller (born 1958), British businessman and philanthropist
Ray Coller (1907–1969), Australian rules footballer"
"A snail is, in loose terms, a shelled gastropod."
"The name is most often applied to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs."
"However, the common name snail is also used for most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into."
"When the word ""snail"" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also numerous species of sea snails and freshwater snails."
"Gastropods that naturally lack a shell, or have only an internal shell, are mostly called slugs, and land snails that have only a very small shell (that they cannot retract into) are often called semi-slugs."
"Snails have considerable human relevance, including as food items, as pests, and as vectors of disease, and their shells are used as decorative objects and are incorporated into jewelry."
"The snail has also had some cultural significance, tending to be associated with lethargy."
The snail has also been used as a figure of speech in reference to slow-moving things.
The snail is the same or similar shape as the cochlea.
"A suit or lounge suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes."
It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes.
The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing.
"After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit."
A black lounge suit for professional occasions became known as a business suit and belongs to the day dress of the semi-formal wear dress code.Suits are offered in different designs and constructions.
"Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories."
A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat.
Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture.
"Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap."
"Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry."
"Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively."
"Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth."
"These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences."
"Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments."
"Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways:

bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available;
ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required;
suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options"
The Hunting Ground is a 2015 American documentary film about the incidence of sexual assault on college campuses in the United States and the reported failure of college administrations to deal with it adequately.
"Written and directed by Kirby Dick and produced by Amy Ziering, it premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival."
"The film was released on February 27, 2015, an edited version aired on CNN on November 22, 2015, and was released on DVD the week of December 1, 2015."
It was released on Netflix in March 2016.
"Lady Gaga recorded an original song, ""Til It Happens to You,"" for the film, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song.The documentary focuses on Annie E. Clark and Andrea Pino, two former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students who filed a Title IX complaint against UNC in response to their rapes while enrolled."
"The use of Title IX in campus sexual assault cases became a model for universities across the country.Critics of the film, including writer Emily Yoffe and a number of Harvard Law School professors, have questioned The Hunting Ground's accuracy and objectivity."
(Harvard was one of the institutions criticized for minimizing the issue of sexual assault and protecting an alleged perpetrator.)
"Among the issues raised by critics are the film's portrayal of one man as a rapist, while not disclosing that the university and the police had found him not responsible for the alleged sexual assault, and for use of controversial statistics."
The filmmakers have actively defended their work.
"In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight."
"The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning ""to pull, to draw""."
"Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as ""engines""), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units."
"Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons."
"Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails."
"Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport."
"Trains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables."
"Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before."
Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities.
"Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power."
"Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned."
The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.
"Since the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport."
"High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances."
"Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century."
"Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks."
"While conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation."
"Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes."
"Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains."
Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
"Scutellaria lateriflora, known commonly as blue skullcap, mad dog skullcap, and side-flowering skullcap, is a hardy perennial herb of the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to North America."
"It has an upright habit, growing 60 to 80 centimeters in maximum height."
"It is a wetland-loving species and grows near marshes, meadows, and other wet habitat."
The blue flowers are just under a centimeter long.
"Most of the flowers do not appear at the top of the main stem, but are produced along the length of side branches that grow from the leaf axils."
"In psychoanalysis, egosyntonic refers to the behaviors, values, and feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable to the needs and goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self-image."
"Egodystonic (or ego alien) is the opposite, referring to thoughts and behaviors (dreams, compulsions, desires, etc.)"
"that are in conflict, or dissonant, with the needs and goals of the ego, or, further, in conflict with a person's ideal self-image."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"Perspiration, also known as sweating, is the production of fluids secreted by the sweat glands in the skin of mammals.Two types of sweat glands can be found in humans: eccrine glands and apocrine glands."
"The eccrine sweat glands are distributed over much of the body and are responsible for secreting the watery, brackish sweat most often triggered by excessive body temperature."
"The apocrine sweat glands are restricted to the armpits and a few other areas of the body and produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion which then gains its characteristic odor from bacterial decomposition."
"In humans, sweating is primarily a means of thermoregulation, which is achieved by the water-rich secretion of the eccrine glands."
"Maximum sweat rates of an adult can be up to 2–4 liters per hour or 10–14 liters per day (10–15 g/min·m2), but is less in children prior to puberty."
Evaporation of sweat from the skin surface has a cooling effect due to evaporative cooling.
"Hence, in hot weather, or when the individual's muscles heat up due to exertion, more sweat is produced."
"Animals with few sweat glands, such as dogs, accomplish similar temperature regulation results by panting, which evaporates water from the moist lining of the oral cavity and pharynx."
"Although sweating is found in a wide variety of mammals, relatively few (exceptions include humans and horses) produce large amounts of sweat in order to cool down."
Stetson is a brand of hat manufactured by the John B. Stetson Company.
John B. Stetson gained inspiration for his most famous hats when he headed west from his native New Jersey for health reasons.
"On his return east in 1865, he founded the John B. Stetson Company in Philadelphia."
"He created a hat that has become symbolic of the pioneering American West, the ""Boss of the Plains""."
This Western hat would become the cornerstone of Stetson's hat business and is still in production today.
"Stetson eventually became the world's largest hat maker, producing more than 3,300,000 hats a year in a factory spread over 9 acres (36,000 m2) in Philadelphia."
"In addition to its Western and fashion hats, Stetson also produces fragrance, apparel, footwear, eyewear, belts, bourbon, and other products evoking the historic American West."
Stetson University and Stetson University College of Law in Florida were named after John B. Stetson in 1899 for his contributions to the school.
A suitcase is a form of luggage.
"It is often a somewhat flat, rectangular-shaped bag with rounded square corners."
"Vinyl, leather or cloth suitcases may have a metal frame."
Hardshell suitcases open on hinges like a door.
"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system."
"The pumped blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the body, while carrying metabolic waste such as carbon dioxide to the lungs."
"In humans, the heart is approximately the size of a closed fist and is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest.In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles."
Commonly the right atrium and ventricle are referred together as the right heart and their left counterparts as the left heart.
"Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers."
"In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow."
"The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid."
"The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node."
"These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart."
"The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle."
"From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide."
"Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide."
The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute.
"Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the most common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths."
Of these more than three-quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke.
"Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others."
Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath.
"Diagnosis of heart disease is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, echocardiogram, and ultrasound."
"Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment."
"In zoology, a tentacle is a flexible, mobile, elongated organ present in some species of animals, most of them invertebrates."
"In animal anatomy, tentacles usually occur in one or more pairs."
"Anatomically, the tentacles of animals work mainly like muscular hydrostats."
Most forms of tentacles are used for grasping and feeding.
"Many are sensory organs, variously receptive to touch, vision, or to the smell or taste of particular foods or threats."
Examples of such tentacles are the eyestalks of various kinds of snails.
Some kinds of tentacles have both sensory and manipulatory functions.
"A tentacle is similar to a cirrus, but a cirrus is an organ that usually lacks the tentacle's strength, size, flexibility, or sensitivity."
"A nautilus has cirri, but a squid has tentacles."
"A carousel (American English: from French carrousel and Italian carosello), roundabout (British English), hurdy-gurdy (Australian English, esp."
"SA), or merry-go-round, is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders."
"The ""seats"" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music."
"This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper (however see ‘direction of rotation’ below)."
"Other popular names are jumper, horseabout, horse tornado and flying horses.Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include a variety of mounts, for example pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns."
"Sometimes, chair-like or bench-like seats are used, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars."
"The ""roundabouts"" or ""merry-go-rounds"" installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices: simple, child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding."
Grandparents are the parents of a person's father or mother – paternal or maternal.
"Every sexually-reproducing living organism who is not a genetic chimera has a maximum of four genetic grandparents, eight genetic great-grandparents, sixteen genetic great-great-grandparents, thirty-two genetic great-great-great-grandparents, etc."
"In the history of modern humanity, around 30,000 years ago, the number of modern humans who lived to be a grandparent increased."
"It is not known for certain what spurred this increase in longevity but largely results in the improved medical technology and living standard, but it is generally believed that a key consequence of three generations being alive together was the preservation of information which could otherwise have been lost; an example of this important information might have been where to find water in times of drought.In cases where parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for their children (e.g., financial obstacles, marriage problems, illness or death), grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers."
"Even when this is not the case, and particularly in traditional cultures, grandparents often have a direct and clear role in relation to the raising, care and nurture of children."
Grandparents are second-degree relatives to their grandchildren and share 25% genetic overlap.
A step-grandparent can be the step-parent of the parent or the step-parent's parent or the step-parent's step-parent (though technically this might be called a step-step-grandparent).
"The various words for grandparents at times may also be used to refer to any elderly person, especially the terms gramps, granny, grandfather, granddad, grandmother, nan, maw-maw, paw-paw (and others which families make up themselves)"
"A plan is typically any diagram or list of steps with details of timing and resources, used to achieve an objective to do something."
It is commonly understood as a temporal set of intended actions through which one expects to achieve a goal.
For spatial or planar topologic or topographic sets see map.
"Plans can be formal or informal:

Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, sports, games, or in the conduct of other business."
"In most cases, the absence of a well-laid plan can have adverse effects: for example, a non-robust project plan can cost the organization time and money."
"Informal or ad hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits.The most popular ways to describe plans are by their breadth, time frame, and specificity; however, these planning classifications are not independent of one another."
"For instance, there is a close relationship between the short- and long-term categories and the strategic and operational categories."
"It is common for less formal plans to be created as abstract ideas, and remain in that form as they are maintained and put to use."
"More formal plans as used for business and military purposes, while initially created with and as an abstract thought, are likely to be written down, drawn up or otherwise stored in a form that is accessible to multiple people across time and space."
This allows more reliable collaboration in the execution of the plan.
"The thumb is the first digit of the hand, next to the index finger."
"When a person is standing in the medical anatomical position (where the palm is facing to the front), the thumb is the outermost digit."
"The Medical Latin English noun for thumb is pollex (compare hallux for big toe), and the corresponding adjective for thumb is pollical."
Canada is a country in North America.
"Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area."
"Its southern and western border with the United States, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi), is the world's longest bi-national land border."
"Canada's capital is Ottawa, and its three largest metropolitan areas are Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver."
Indigenous peoples have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years.
"Beginning in the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast."
"As a consequence of various armed conflicts, France ceded nearly all of its colonies in North America in 1763."
"In 1867, with the union of three British North American colonies through Confederation, Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces."
This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom.
"This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom."
Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition.
"The country's head of government is the prime minister—who holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the elected House of Commons—and is appointed by the governor general, representing the monarch, who serves as head of state."
The country is a Commonwealth realm and is officially bilingual at the federal level.
"It ranks among the highest in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education."
"It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of large-scale immigration from many other countries."
Canada's long and complex relationship with the United States has had a significant impact on its economy and culture.
"A highly developed country, Canada has the 24th highest nominal per-capita income globally and the sixteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index."
"Its advanced economy is the ninth-largest in the world, relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks."
"Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the United Nations, NATO, the G7, the Group of Ten, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Commonwealth of Nations, the Arctic Council, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the Organization of American States."
"In law, a hearing is a proceeding before a court or other decision-making body or officer, such as a government agency or a legislative committee.A hearing is generally distinguished from a trial in that it is usually shorter and often less formal."
"In the course of litigation, hearings are conducted as oral arguments in support of motions, whether to resolve the case without further trial on a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, or to decide discrete issues of law, such as the admissibility of evidence, that will determine how the trial proceeds."
Limited evidence and testimony may also be presented in hearings to supplement the legal arguments.
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
"The Movement is an American reggae band originally formed in Columbia, South Carolina, in 2003."
"The two founding members, Josh Swain and Jordan Miller, then relocated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where they acquired a live rhythm section in the form of local Philadelphia musicians Jay Schmidt and Gary Jackson."
The band has released six studio albums.
"Their music is commonly described as a fusion of rock, reggae, hip hop and acoustic music."
"A land mine is an explosive device concealed under or on the ground and designed to destroy or disable enemy targets, ranging from combatants to vehicles and tanks, as they pass over or near it."
"Such a device is typically detonated automatically by way of pressure when a target steps on it or drives over it, although other detonation mechanisms are also sometimes used."
"A land mine may cause damage by direct blast effect, by fragments that are thrown by the blast, or by both."
The use of land mines is controversial because of their potential as indiscriminate weapons.
"They can remain dangerous many years after a conflict has ended, harming civilians and the economy."
"Seventy-eight countries are contaminated with land mines and 15,000–20,000 people are killed every year while many more are injured."
"Approximately 80% of land mine casualties are civilians, with children as the most affected age group."
Most killings occur in times of peace.
"With pressure from a number of campaign groups organised through the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, a global movement to prohibit their use led to the 1997 Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, also known as the Ottawa Treaty."
"To date, 164 nations have signed the treaty, but these do not include China, the Russian Federation, and the United States."
"Bagger, packer, sacker or bag boy (US), is an unofficial title given to a courtesy clerk at a grocery store."
"A couch, also known as a sofa, settee, futton, or chesterfield (see Etymology below), is a piece of furniture for seating multiple people."
"It is commonly found in the form of a bench, with upholstered armrests, and often fitted with springs and tailored cushion and pillows."
"Although a couch is used primarily for seating, it may be used for sleeping."
"In homes, couches are normally put in the family room, living room, den or lounge."
"They are sometimes also found in non-residential settings such as hotels, lobbies of commercial offices, waiting rooms, and bars."
"Couches can also vary in size, color, and design."
"An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process."
The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process.
It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result.
An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough.
Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field.
An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.
An inventor is a person who creates or discovers an invention.
"The word inventor comes from the Latin verb invenire, invent-, to find."
"Although inventing is closely associated with science and engineering, inventors are not necessarily engineers nor scientists.Some inventions can be patented."
"The system of patents was established to encourage inventors by granting limited-term, limited monopoly on inventions determined to be sufficiently novel, non-obvious, and useful."
A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention.
The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.
"Another meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others."
The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.
Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity.
"Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability."
"A cupcake (also British English: fairy cake; Hiberno-English: bun) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup."
"As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied."
"Coffee jelly (コーヒーゼリー, kōhī zerī) is a jelly dessert flavored with coffee and sugar."
"Although once common in British and American cookbooks, it is now most common in Japan, where it can be found in most restaurants and convenience stores."
Coffee jelly can be made using instant mix or from scratch.
It is served in restaurants and cafés.
"Ice is water frozen into a solid state, typically forming at or below temperatures of 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color."
"In the Solar System, ice is abundant and occurs naturally from as close to the Sun as Mercury to as far away as the Oort cloud objects."
"Beyond the Solar System, it occurs as interstellar ice."
"It is abundant on Earth's surface – particularly in the polar regions and above the snow line – and, as a common form of precipitation and deposition, plays a key role in Earth's water cycle and climate."
"It falls as snowflakes and hail or occurs as frost, icicles or ice spikes and aggregates from snow as glaciers and ice sheets."
"Ice exhibits at least eighteen phases (packing geometries), depending on temperature and pressure."
"When water is cooled rapidly (quenching), up to three types of amorphous ice can form depending on its history of pressure and temperature."
"When cooled slowly, correlated proton tunneling occurs below −253.15 °C (20 K, −423.67 °F) giving rise to macroscopic quantum phenomena."
"Virtually all ice on Earth's surface and in its atmosphere is of a hexagonal crystalline structure denoted as ice Ih (spoken as ""ice one h"") with minute traces of cubic ice, denoted as ice Ic and, more recently found, Ice VII inclusions in diamonds."
"The most common phase transition to ice Ih occurs when liquid water is cooled below 0 °C (273.15 K, 32 °F) at standard atmospheric pressure."
"It may also be deposited directly by water vapor, as happens in the formation of frost."
The transition from ice to water is melting and from ice directly to water vapor is sublimation.
"Ice is used in a variety of ways, including for cooling, for winter sports, and ice sculpting."
"The cat flea (scientific name Ctenocephalides felis) is an extremely common parasitic insect whose principal host is the domestic cat, although a high proportion of the fleas found on dogs also belong to this species."
"This is despite the widespread existence of a separate and well-established ""dog"" flea, Ctenocephalides canis."
Cat fleas originated in Africa  but can now be found globally.
"As humans began domesticating cats, the prevalence of the cat flea increased and spread throughout the world."
"Of the cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis felis is the most common, although other subspecies do exist, including C. felis strongylus, C. orientis, and C. damarensis."
Over 90% of fleas found on both dogs and cats are Ctenocephalides felis felis.
A stew is a combination of solid food ingredients that have been cooked in liquid and served in the resultant gravy.
"Ingredients in a stew can include any combination of vegetables and may include meat, especially tougher meats suitable for slow-cooking, such as beef, pork, lamb, poultry, sausages, and seafood."
"While water can be used as the stew-cooking liquid, stock is also common."
A small amount of red wine is sometimes added for flavour.
Seasoning and flavourings may also be added.
"Stews are typically cooked at a relatively low temperature (simmered, not boiled), allowing flavours to mingle."
Stewing is suitable for the least tender cuts of meat that become tender and juicy with the slow moist heat method.
This makes it popular in low-cost cooking.
"Cuts having a certain amount of marbling and gelatinous connective tissue give moist, juicy stews, while lean meat may easily become dry."
"Stews are thickened by reduction or with flour, either by coating pieces of meat with flour before searing, or by using a roux or beurre manié, a dough consisting of equal parts of fat and flour."
"Thickeners like cornstarch, potato starch, or arrowroot may also be used."
"Stews are similar to soups, and in some cases there may not be a clear distinction between the two."
"Generally, stews have less liquid than soups, are much thicker and require longer cooking over low heat."
"While soups are almost always served in a bowl, stews may be thick enough to be served on a plate with the gravy as a sauce over the solid ingredients."
"Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that ""involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior""."
"The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology.Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime."
"As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory."
"Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:
Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined;
Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action."
"The Scottish Terrier (Scottish Gaelic: Abhag Albannach; also known as the Aberdeen Terrier), popularly called the Scottie, is a breed of dog."
"Initially one of the highland breeds of terrier that were grouped under the name of Skye Terrier, it is one of five breeds of terrier that originated in Scotland, the other four being the modern Skye, Cairn, Dandie Dinmont, and West Highland White Terriers."
They are an independent and rugged breed with a wiry outer coat and a soft dense undercoat.
"The First Earl of Dumbarton nicknamed the breed ""the diehard""."
"According to legend, the Earl of Dumbarton gave this nickname because of the Scottish Terriers' bravery, and Scotties were also the inspiration for the name of his regiment, The Royal Scots, Dumbarton’s Diehard."
"Scottish Terriers, also known as Scotties, were originally bred to hunt vermin on farms."
They are a small breed of terrier with a distinctive shape and have had many roles in popular culture.
"They have been owned by a variety of celebrities, including the 32nd president of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose Scottie Fala is included with FDR in a statue in Washington, D.C., as well as by the 43rd president, George W. Bush."
They are also well known for being a playing piece in the board game Monopoly.
"Described as territorial, feisty dogs, they can make a good watchdog and tend to be very loyal to their family."
"Healthwise, Scottish Terriers can be more prone to bleeding disorders, joint disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergies, and cancer than some other breeds of dog, and there is a condition named after the breed called Scotty cramp."
They are also one of the more successful dog breeds at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show with a best in show in 2010.
"A company, abbreviated as co., is a legal entity representing an association of people, whether natural, legal or a mixture of both, with a specific objective."
"Company members share a common purpose and unite to achieve specific, declared goals."
"Companies take various forms, such as:

voluntary associations, which may include nonprofit organizations
business entities, whose aim is generating profit
financial entities and banks
programs or educational institutions.A company can be created as a legal person so that the company itself has limited liability as members perform or fail to discharge their duty according to the publicly declared incorporation, or published policy."
"When a company closes, it may need to be liquidated to avoid further legal obligations."
Companies may associate and collectively register themselves as new companies; the resulting entities are often known as corporate groups.
"Mediation  is a structured, interactive process where an impartial third party assists disputing parties in resolving conflict through the use of specialized communication and negotiation techniques."
All participants in mediation are encouraged to actively participate in the process.
"Mediation is a ""party-centered"" process in that it is focused primarily upon the needs, rights, and interests of the parties."
The mediator uses a wide variety of techniques to guide the process in a constructive direction and to help the parties find their optimal solution.
A mediator is facilitative in that she/he manages the interaction between parties and facilitates open communication.
"Mediation is also evaluative in that the mediator analyzes issues and relevant norms (""reality-testing""), while refraining from providing prescriptive advice to the parties (e.g., ""You should do..."")."
"Mediation, as used in law, is a form of alternative dispute resolution resolving disputes between two or more parties with concrete effects."
"Typically, a third party, the mediator, assists the parties to negotiate a settlement."
"Disputants may mediate disputes in a variety of domains, such as commercial, legal, diplomatic, workplace, community, and family matters."
The term mediation broadly refers to any instance in which a third party helps others reach an agreement.
"More specifically, mediation has a structure, timetable, and dynamics that ""ordinary"" negotiation lacks."
"The process is private and confidential, possibly enforced by law."
Participation is typically voluntary.
The mediator acts as a neutral third party and facilitates rather than directs the process.
Mediation is becoming a more peaceful and internationally accepted solution to end the conflict.
Mediation can be used to resolve disputes of any magnitude.
"The term mediation, however, due to language as well as national legal standards and regulations is not identical in content in all countries but rather has specific connotations, and there are some differences between Anglo-Saxon definitions and other countries, especially countries with a civil, statutory law tradition.Mediators use various techniques to open, or improve, dialogue and empathy between disputants, aiming to help the parties reach an agreement."
Much depends on the mediator's skill and training.
"As the practice gained popularity, training programs, certifications, and licensing followed, which produced trained and professional mediators committed to the discipline."
"Safety signs are a type of sign designed to warn of hazards, indicate mandatory actions or required use of Personal protective equipment, prohibit actions or objects, identify the location of firefighting or safety equipment, or marking of exit routes."
"In addition to being encountered in industrial facilities; safety signs are also found in public places and communities, at electrical pylons and Electrical substations, cliffs, beaches, bodies of water, on motorized equipment, such as lawn mowers, and areas closed for construction or demolition."
"Onionskin or onion skin is a thin, lightweight, strong, often translucent paper."
"Though not made from onions, it superficially resembles their thin, papery skins."
"It was usually used with carbon paper for typing duplicates in a typewriter, for permanent records where low bulk was important, or for airmail correspondence."
"It is typically 25–39 g/m2 (9-pound basis weight in US units), and may be white or canary-colored."
"In the typewriter era, onion skin often had a deeply textured cockle finish which allowed for easier erasure of typing mistakes, but other glazed and unglazed finishes were also available then and may be more common today."
Onionskin paper is relatively durable and lightweight due to its high content of cotton fibers.
"Because of these attributes and its crispness when folding, onionskin paper is one of the best papers to use for toy kites and advanced paper airplanes."
Paper airplanes made from onionskin paper tend to fly very well due to their low weight and high integrity once folded.
Onionskin paper has also been regularly used in traditional cel animation.
"Due to its translucency, it is used as a guide in drawing the frames between key-frames."
"This is a process that animators refer to as ""in-betweening""."
"The process of ""onionskinning"" is also used in digital animation where frames are represented by digital layers in a production."
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.
"It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds composed of atoms, molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology."
It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
"For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant chemistry (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics)."
Chemistry addresses topics such as how atoms and molecules interact via chemical bonds to form new chemical compounds.
"There are two types of chemical bonds: 1. primary chemical bonds e.g covalent bonds, in which atoms share one or more electron(s); ionic bonds, in which an atom donates one or more electrons to another atom to produce ions (cations and anions); metallic bonds and 2. secondary chemical bonds e.g."
"hydrogen bonds; Van der Waals force bonds, ion-ion interaction, ion-dipole interaction etc."
"General Baptists are Baptists who hold the general or unlimited atonement view, the belief that Jesus Christ died for the entire world and not just for the chosen elect."
"General Baptists are theologically Arminian, which distinguishes them from Reformed Baptists (also known as ""Particular Baptists"" for their belief in particular redemption).Free Will Baptists are General Baptists; opponents of the English General Baptists in North Carolina dubbed them ""Freewillers"" and they later assumed the name.General Baptist denominations have explicated their faith in two major confessions of faith, ""The Standard Confession"" (1660), and ""The Orthodox Creed"" (1678)."
"Positive feedback (exacerbating feedback, self-reinforcing feedback) is a process that occurs in a feedback loop which exacerbates the effects of a small disturbance."
"That is, the effects of a perturbation on a system include an increase in the magnitude of the perturbation."
"That is, A produces more of B which in turn produces more of A."
"In contrast, a system in which the results of a change act to reduce or counteract it has negative feedback."
"Both concepts play an important role in science and engineering, including biology, chemistry, and cybernetics."
"Mathematically, positive feedback is defined as a positive loop gain around a closed loop of cause and effect."
"That is, positive feedback is in phase with the input, in the sense that it adds to make the input larger."
Positive feedback tends to cause system instability.
"When the loop gain is positive and above 1, there will typically be exponential growth, increasing oscillations, chaotic behavior or other divergences from equilibrium."
"System parameters will typically accelerate towards extreme values, which may damage or destroy the system, or may end with the system latched into a new stable state."
"Positive feedback may be controlled by signals in the system being filtered, damped, or limited, or it can be cancelled or reduced by adding negative feedback."
Positive feedback is used in digital electronics to force voltages away from intermediate voltages into '0' and '1' states.
"On the other hand, thermal runaway is a type of positive feedback that can destroy semiconductor junctions."
"Positive feedback in chemical reactions can increase the rate of reactions, and in some cases can lead to explosions."
"Positive feedback in mechanical design causes tipping-point, or 'over-centre', mechanisms to snap into position, for example in switches and locking pliers."
"Out of control, it can cause bridges to collapse."
Positive feedback in economic systems can cause boom-then-bust cycles.
"A familiar example of positive feedback is the loud squealing or howling sound produced by audio feedback in public address systems: the microphone picks up sound from its own loudspeakers, amplifies it, and sends it through the speakers again."
"Gothic fiction, sometimes called Gothic horror in the 20th century, is a genre of literature and film that covers horror, death, and at times, romance."
"It is said to derive from the English author Horace Walpole's 1764 novel The Castle of Otranto, later subtitled ""A Gothic Story""."
"Early contributors included Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis."
It tends to stress emotion and a pleasurable terror that expands the Romantic literature of the time.
"The common ""pleasures"" were the sublime, which indescribably ""takes us beyond ourselves."""
"Such extreme Romanticism was popular throughout Europe, especially among English and German-language authors."
"Its 19th-century success peaked with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and work by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Edgar Allan Poe and Charles Dickens, and in poetry with Samuel Taylor Coleridge."
"Also prominent was the later Dracula by Bram Stoker, Richard Marsh's The Beetle and Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson."
"The name Gothic spread from the Goths to mean ""German""."
"It also draws in Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages, where many of the stories occur."
"Twentieth-century contributors include Daphne du Maurier, Stephen King, Shirley Jackson, Anne Rice and Toni Morrison."
A wish is a hope or desire for something.
"In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices."
"In folklore, opportunities for ""making a wish"" or for wishes to ""come true"" or ""be granted"" are themes that are sometimes used."
A volcanic crater is an approximately circular depression in the ground caused by volcanic activity.
It is typically a bowl-shaped feature within which contains either multiple vents or a singular vent.
"During volcanic eruptions, molten magma and volcanic gases  rise from an underground magma chamber, through a tube-shaped conduit, until they reach the crater's vent, from where the gases escape into the atmosphere and the magma is erupted as lava."
"A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth."
"During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano's magma chamber may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger depression known as a caldera."
"In the anatomy of humans and homologous primates, the descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon."
The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum.
The descending colon is on the left side of the body (barring any malformations).
The term left colon is hypernymous to descending colon in precise use; many casual mentions of the left colon chiefly concern the descending colon.
"An umbrella or parasol is a folding canopy supported by wooden or metal ribs that is usually mounted on a wooden, metal, or plastic pole."
It is designed to protect a person against rain or sunlight.
"The term umbrella is traditionally used when protecting oneself from rain, with parasol used when protecting oneself from sunlight, though the terms continue to be used interchangeably."
"Often the difference is the material used for the canopy; some parasols are not waterproof, and some umbrellas are transparent."
Umbrella canopies may be made of fabric or flexible plastic.
"There are also combinations of parasol and umbrella that are called en-tout-cas (French for ""in any case"").Umbrellas and parasols are primarily hand-held portable devices sized for personal use."
The largest hand-portable umbrellas are golf umbrellas.
"Umbrellas can be divided into two categories: fully collapsible umbrellas, in which the metal pole supporting the canopy retracts, making the umbrella small enough to fit in a handbag, and non-collapsible umbrellas, in which the support pole cannot retract and only the canopy can be collapsed."
"Another distinction can be made between manually operated umbrellas and spring-loaded automatic umbrellas, which spring open at the press of a button."
"Hand-held umbrellas have a type of handle which can be made from wood, a plastic cylinder or a bent ""crook"" handle (like the handle of a cane)."
"Umbrellas are available in a range of price and quality points, ranging from inexpensive, modest quality models sold at discount stores to expensive, finely made, designer-labeled models."
"Larger parasols capable of blocking the sun for several people are often used as fixed or semi-fixed devices, used with patio tables or other outdoor furniture, or as points of shade on a sunny beach."
Parasols are occasionally called sunshades.
"An umbrella may also be called a brolly (UK slang), parapluie (nineteenth century, French origin), rainshade, gamp (British, informal, dated), or bumbershoot (rare, facetious American slang)."
"When used for snow, it is called a paraneige."
"In mathematics and computer science, apply is a function that applies a function to arguments."
"It is central to programming languages derived from lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme, and also in functional languages."
"It has a role in the study of the denotational semantics of computer programs, because it is a continuous function on complete partial orders."
"Apply is also a continuous function in homotopy theory, and, indeed underpins the entire theory: it allows a homotopy deformation to be viewed as a continuous path in the space of functions."
"Likewise, valid mutations (refactorings) of computer programs can be seen as those that are ""continuous"" in the Scott topology."
"The most general setting for apply is in category theory, where it is right adjoint to currying in closed monoidal categories."
"A special case of this are the Cartesian closed categories, whose internal language is simply typed lambda calculus."
"In mathematics, the limit inferior and limit superior of a sequence can be thought of as limiting (that is, eventual and extreme) bounds on the sequence."
They can be thought of in a similar fashion for a function (see limit of a function).
"For a set, they are the infimum and supremum of the set's limit points, respectively."
"In general, when there are multiple objects around which a sequence, function, or set accumulates, the inferior and superior limits extract the smallest and largest of them; the type of object and the measure of size is context-dependent, but the notion of extreme limits is invariant."
"Limit inferior is also called infimum limit, limit infimum, liminf, inferior limit, lower limit, or inner limit; limit superior is also known as supremum limit, limit supremum, limsup, superior limit, upper limit, or outer limit."
"The limit inferior of a sequence 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{n}}
   is denoted by

The limit superior of a sequence

   is denoted by"
"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
"In mathematics, a group is a set equipped with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and is such that every element has an inverse."
"These three conditions, called group axioms, hold for number systems and many other mathematical structures."
"For example, the integers together with the addition operation form a group."
"The formulation of the axioms is, however, detached from the concrete nature of the group and its operation."
"This allows one to handle entities of very different mathematical origins in a flexible way, while retaining essential structural aspects of many mathematical objects."
"The ubiquity of groups in numerous areas—both within and outside mathematics—makes them a central organizing principle of contemporary mathematics.Groups arise naturally in geometry for the study of symmetries and geometric transformations: the symmetries of an object form a group, called the symmetry group of the object, and the transformations of a given type form generally a group."
These examples were at the origin of the concept of group (together with Galois groups).
Lie groups arise as symmetry groups in geometry but appear also in the Standard Model of particle physics.
The Poincaré group is a Lie group consisting of the symmetries of spacetime in special relativity.
Point groups describe symmetry in molecular chemistry.
"The concept of a group arose from the study of polynomial equations, starting with Évariste Galois in the 1830s, who introduced the term group (groupe, in French) for the symmetry group of the roots of an equation, now called a Galois group."
"After contributions from other fields such as number theory and geometry, the group notion was generalized and firmly established around 1870."
Modern group theory—an active mathematical discipline—studies groups in their own right.
"To explore groups, mathematicians have devised various notions to break groups into smaller, better-understandable pieces, such as subgroups, quotient groups and simple groups."
"In addition to their abstract properties, group theorists also study the different ways in which a group can be expressed concretely, both from a point of view of representation theory (that is, through the representations of the group) and of computational group theory."
"A theory has been developed for finite groups, which culminated with the classification of finite simple groups, completed in 2004."
"Since the mid-1980s, geometric group theory, which studies finitely generated groups as geometric objects, has become an active area in group theory."
Headphones are a pair of small loudspeaker drivers worn on or around the head over a user's ears.
"They are electroacoustic transducers, which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound."
"Headphones let a single user listen to an audio source privately, in contrast to a loudspeaker, which emits sound into the open air for anyone nearby to hear."
"Headphones are also known as earspeakers, earphones or, colloquially, cans."
Circumaural ('around the ear') and supra-aural ('over the ear') headphones use a band over the top of the head to hold the speakers in place.
"Another type, known as earbuds or earpieces consist of individual units that plug into the user's ear canal."
"A third type are bone conduction headphones, which typically wrap around the back of the head and rest in front of the ear canal, leaving the ear canal open."
"In the context of telecommunication, a headset is a combination of headphone and microphone."
"Headphones connect to a signal source such as an audio amplifier, radio, CD player, portable media player, mobile phone, video game console, or electronic musical instrument, either directly using a cord, or using wireless technology such as Bluetooth, DECT or FM radio."
"The first headphones were developed in the late 19th century for use by telephone operators, to keep their hands free."
Initially the audio quality was mediocre and a step forward was the invention of high fidelity headphones.Headphones exhibit a range of different audio reproduction quality capabilities.
Headsets designed for telephone use typically cannot reproduce sound with the high fidelity of expensive units designed for music listening by audiophiles.
Headphones that use cables typically have either a 1/4 inch (6.35mm) or 1/8 inch (3.5mm) phone jack for plugging the headphones into the audio source.
"Some stereo earbuds are wireless, using Bluetooth connectivity to transmit the audio signal by radio waves from source devices like cellphones and digital players."
"As a result of the Walkman effect beginning in the 1980s, headphones started to be used in public places such as sidewalks, grocery stores, and public transit."
"Headphones are also used by people in various professional contexts, such as audio engineers mixing sound for live concerts or sound recordings and DJs, who use headphones to cue up the next song without the audience hearing, aircraft pilots and call center employees."
The latter two types of employees use headphones with an integrated microphone.
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Experience refers to conscious events in general, more specifically to perceptions, or to the practical knowledge and familiarity that is produced by these conscious processes."
"Understood as a conscious event in the widest sense, experience involves a subject to which various items are presented."
"In this sense, seeing a yellow bird on a branch presents the subject with the objects ""bird"" and ""branch"", the relation between them and the property ""yellow""."
"Unreal items may be included as well, which happens when experiencing hallucinations or dreams."
"When understood in a more restricted sense, only sensory consciousness counts as experience."
"In this sense, experience is usually identified with perception and contrasted with other types of conscious events, like thinking or imagining."
"In a slightly different sense, experience refers not to the conscious events themselves but to the practical knowledge and familiarity they produce."
"In this sense, it is important that direct perceptual contact with the external world is the source of knowledge."
"So an experienced hiker is someone who actually lived through many hikes, not someone who merely read many books about hiking."
This is associated both with recurrent past acquaintance and the abilities learned through them.
"Many scholarly debates on the nature of experience focus on experience as conscious event, either in the wide or the more restricted sense."
"One important topic in this field is the question of whether all experiences are intentional, i.e."
are directed at objects different from themselves.
"Another debate focuses on the question of whether there are non-conceptual experiences and, if so, what role they could play in justifying beliefs."
"Some theorists claim that experiences are transparent, meaning that what an experience feels like only depends on the contents presented in this experience."
Other theorists reject this claim by pointing out that what matters is not just what is presented but also how it is presented.
A great variety of types of experiences is discussed in the academic literature.
"Perceptual experiences, for example, represent the external world through stimuli registered and transmitted by the senses."
"The experience of episodic memory, on the other hand, involves reliving a past event one experienced before."
"In imaginative experience, objects are presented without aiming to show how things actually are."
"The experience of thinking involves mental representations and the processing of information, in which ideas or propositions are entertained, judged or connected."
Pleasure refers to experience that feels good.
"It is closely related to emotional experience, which has additionally evaluative, physiological and behavioral components."
"Moods are similar to emotions, with one key difference being that they lack a specific object found in emotions."
Conscious desires involve the experience of wanting something.
"They play a central role in the experience of agency, in which intentions are formed, courses of action are planned, and decisions are taken and realized."
"Non-ordinary experience refers to rare experiences that significantly differ from the experience in the ordinary waking state, like religious experiences, out-of-body experiences or near-death experiences."
Experience is discussed in various disciplines.
Phenomenology is the science of the structure and contents of experience.
"It uses different methods, like epoché or eidetic variation."
Sensory experience is of special interest to epistemology.
"An important traditional discussion in this field concerns whether all knowledge is based on sensory experience, as empiricists claim, or not, as rationalists contend."
"This is closely related to the role of experience in science, in which experience is said to act as a neutral arbiter between competing theories."
"In metaphysics, experience is involved in the mind-body problem and the hard problem of consciousness, both of which try to explain the relation between matter and experience."
"In psychology, some theorists hold that all concepts are learned from experience while others argue that some concepts are innate."
Plants are predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae.
"Historically, the plant kingdom encompassed all living things that were not animals, and included algae and fungi; however, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria)."
"By one definition, plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for ""green plants""), a group that includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red and brown algae."
Most plants are multicellular organisms.
Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria.
"Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives them their green color."
"Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but still have flowers, fruits, and seeds."
"Plants are characterized by sexual reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction is also common."
"There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds."
"Green plants provide a substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen, and are the basis of most of Earth's ecosystems."
"Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia."
"Plants have many cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs."
"The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology."
"The raspberry is the edible fruit of a multitude of plant species in the genus Rubus of the rose family, most of which are in the subgenus Idaeobatus."
The name also applies to these plants themselves.
Raspberries are perennial with woody stems.
"World production of raspberries in 2019 was 822,493 tonnes, led by Russia with approximately 21% of the total."
"Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians."
"Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope."
"Monkeys are divided into the families of New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys (Cercopithecidae in the strict sense; Catarrhini in the broad sense, which again includes apes)."
"Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons."
Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal).
"Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys."
"Simians and tarsiers, the two members of the suborder Haplorhini, emerged some 60 million years ago."
New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago.
Old World monkeys and apes emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago.
"Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35–32 million years ago] are also considered monkeys by primatologists.Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini)."
"The simians' sister group, the tarsiers are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys."
"Apes emerged within ""monkeys"" as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well."
"There has been resistance to directly designate apes (and thus humans) as monkeys, so ""Old World monkey"" may be taken to mean either the Cercopithecoidea (not including apes) or the Catarrhini (including apes)."
"That apes are monkeys was already realized by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in the 18th century.Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers."
A wing is a type of fin that produces lift while moving through air or some other fluid.
"Accordingly, wings have streamlined cross-sections that are subject to aerodynamic forces and act as airfoils."
A wing's aerodynamic efficiency is expressed as its lift-to-drag ratio.
The lift a wing generates at a given speed and angle of attack can be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the total drag on the wing.
A high lift-to-drag ratio requires a significantly smaller thrust to propel the wings through the air at sufficient lift.
"Lifting structures used in water include various foils, such as hydrofoils."
"Hydrodynamics is the governing science, rather than aerodynamics."
"Applications of underwater foils occur in hydroplanes, sailboats and submarines."
The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally from Southeastern Asia.
"Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel."
A male that has been castrated is a capon.
An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.
"Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC)."
Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
"Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, up from more than 19 billion in 2011."
There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
"There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature."
"Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent."
"From ancient India, the chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC."
"Fowl have been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the ""bird that gives birth every day"" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III."
"The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family."
Most violins have a hollow wooden body.
It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use.
"The violin typically has four strings, (some can have five), usually tuned in perfect fifths with notes G3, D4, A4, E5, and is most commonly played by drawing a bow across its strings."
"It can also be played by plucking the strings with the fingers (pizzicato) and, in specialized cases, by striking the strings with the wooden side of the bow (col legno)."
Violins are important instruments in a wide variety of musical genres.
"They are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments."
"Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz."
"Electric violins with solid bodies and piezoelectric pickups are used in some forms of rock music and jazz fusion, with the pickups plugged into instrument amplifiers and speakers to produce sound."
"The violin has come to be incorporated in many non-Western music cultures, including Indian music and Iranian music."
The name fiddle is often used regardless of the type of music played on it.
"The violin was first known in 16th-century Italy, with some further modifications occurring in the 18th and 19th centuries to give the instrument a more powerful sound and projection."
"In Europe, it served as the basis for the development of other stringed instruments used in Western classical music, such as the viola.Violinists and collectors particularly prize the fine historical instruments made by the Stradivari, Guarneri, Guadagnini and Amati families from the 16th to the 18th century in Brescia and Cremona (Italy) and by Jacob Stainer in Austria."
"According to their reputation, the quality of their sound has defied attempts to explain or equal it, though this belief is disputed."
"Great numbers of instruments have come from the hands of less famous makers, as well as still greater numbers of mass-produced commercial ""trade violins"" coming from cottage industries in places such as Saxony, Bohemia, and Mirecourt."
"Many of these trade instruments were formerly sold by Sears, Roebuck and Co. and other mass merchandisers."
The components of a violin are usually made from different types of wood.
"Violins can be strung with gut, Perlon or other synthetic, or steel strings."
A person who makes or repairs violins is called a luthier or violinmaker.
One who makes or repairs bows is called an archetier or bowmaker.
Winter squash is an annual fruit representing several squash species within the genus Cucurbita.
It differs from summer squash in that it is harvested and eaten in the mature stage when the seeds within have matured fully and the skin has hardened into a tough rind.
"At this stage, most varieties of this vegetable can be stored for use during the winter."
"Winter squash is generally cooked before being eaten, and the skin or rind is not usually eaten as it is with summer squash.Cultivars of winter squash that are round and orange are called pumpkins."
"In New Zealand and Australian English, the term ""pumpkin"" generally refers to the broader category called ""winter squash""."
"Streptococcal pharyngitis, also known as strep throat, is an infection of the back of the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS)."
"Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils (tonsilitis), and enlarged lymph nodes in the neck."
"A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur."
Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever.
Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.Strep throat is spread by respiratory droplets from an infected person.
"It may be spread directly or by touching something that has droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes."
Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms.
It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep.
The diagnosis is made based on the results of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.Prevention is by washing hands and not sharing eating utensils.
There is no vaccine for the disease.
Treatment with antibiotics is only recommended in those with a confirmed diagnosis.
Those infected should stay away from other people until fever is gone and for at least 12 hours after starting treatment.
Pain can be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen.Strep throat is a common bacterial infection in children.
It is the cause of 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults.
Cases are more common in late winter and early spring.
Potential complications include rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess.
"A trail is usually a path, track or unpaved lane or road."
"In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, path or footpath is the preferred term for a walking trail."
"The term is also applied in North America to routes along rivers, and sometimes to highways."
"In the US, the term was historically used for a route into or through wild territory used by emigrants (e.g."
the Oregon Trail).
"In the USA ""trace"" is a synonym for trail, as in Natchez Trace."
"Some trails are single use and can be used only for walking, cycling, horse riding, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing; others, as in the case of a bridleway in the UK, are multi-use, and can be used by walkers, cyclists and equestrians."
"There are also unpaved trails used by dirt bikes and other off-road vehicles, and in some places, like the Alps, trails are used for moving cattle and other livestock."
"Eragrostis is a large and widespread genus of plants in the grass family, found in many countries on all inhabited continents and many islands.Eragrostis is commonly known as lovegrass or canegrass."
"The name of the genus is derived from the Greek words ἔρως (eros), meaning ""love"", and ἄγρωστις (agrostis), meaning ""grass"".Lovegrass is commonly used as livestock fodder."
"The seeds appear to be of high nutritional value for some animals, but they are also very tiny and collecting them for human food is cumbersome and hence uncommon."
"A notable exception is teff (E. tef), which is used to make traditional breads on the Horn of Africa, such as Ethiopian injera and Somalian laxoox."
It is a crop of commercial importance.
"E. clelandii and E. tremula are recorded as famine foods in Australia and Chad, respectively.Other species, such as E. amabilis, are used as ornamental plants."
E. cynosuroides is used in the pūjā rites in the Hindu temple at Karighatta.
Bahia lovegrass (E. bahiensis) is known as a hyperaccumulator of caesium-137 and can be grown to remove the highly toxic radioactive atoms from the environment.
Weeping lovegrass (E. curvula) has been planted extensively to prevent soil erosion.
"Seed dispersal is often done by passing animals; the grains' hooks latch on to fur or hair, or to clothes."
Others are wind or gravity dispersed.
"Several herbivores feed on lovegrass, including invertebrates such as the caterpillars of the Zabulon skipper (Poanes zabulon) and vertebrates."
The extinct bluebuck (Hippotragus leucophaeus) was known to graze these grasses.
The dense bunches also provide cover for small animals such as the rare Botteri's sparrow (Aimophila botterii).
"Lovegrasses may be important groundcover on oceanic islands like Laysan, where other plants are rare."
"Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing."
"From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water."
"The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended."
"In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss."
"This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting.In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal."
"Upholstery is the work of providing furniture, especially seats, with padding, springs, webbing, and fabric or leather covers."
The word also refers to the materials used to upholster something.
"Upholstery comes from the Middle English word upholder, which referred to an artisan who makes fabric furnishings."
"The term is equally applicable to domestic, automobile, airplane and boat furniture, and can be applied to mattresses, particularly the upper layers, though these often differ significantly in design."
A person who works with upholstery is called an upholsterer.
An apprentice upholsterer is sometimes called an outsider or trimmer.
"Traditional upholstery uses materials like coil springs (post-1850), animal hair (horse, hog and cow), coir, straw and hay, hessians, linen scrims, wadding, etc., and is done by hand, building each layer up."
"In contrast, today's upholsterers employ synthetic materials like dacron and vinyl, serpentine springs, and so on."
"Jungle Fever is a 1991 American romantic drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee."
"The film stars Wesley Snipes, Annabella Sciorra, Lee, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Samuel L. Jackson, Lonette McKee, John Turturro, Frank Vincent, Halle Berry (in her film debut), Tim Robbins, Brad Dourif, Queen Latifah, Michael Imperioli, and Anthony Quinn, and is Lee's fifth feature-length film."
Jungle Fever explores the beginning and end of an extramarital interracial relationship against the urban backdrop of the streets of New York City in the early 1990s.
"The film received positive reviews, with particular praise for Samuel L. Jackson's performance."
"The vertical bar, |, is a glyph with various uses in mathematics, computing, and typography."
"It has many names, often related to particular meanings: Sheffer stroke (in logic), pipe, vbar, stick, vertical line, bar, verti-bar, and several variants on these names."
Bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi (large and medium-sized airways) in the lungs that causes coughing.
"Symptoms include coughing up sputum, wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest pain."
"Bronchitis can be acute or chronic.Acute bronchitis usually has a cough that lasts around three weeks, and is also known as a chest cold."
In more than 90% of cases the cause is a viral infection.
These viruses may be spread through the air when people cough or by direct contact.
A small number of cases are caused by a bacterial infection such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Bordetella pertussis.
"Risk factors include exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and other air pollution."
"Treatment of acute bronchitis typically involves rest, paracetamol (acetaminophen), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to help with the fever.Chronic bronchitis is defined as a productive cough – one that produces sputum – that lasts for three months or more per year for at least two years."
Many people with chronic bronchitis also have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
"Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role."
"Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids."
Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy.Acute bronchitis is one of the more common diseases.
About 5% of adults and 6% of children have at least one episode a year.
Acute bronchitis is the most common type of bronchitis.
"By contrast in the United States, in 2018, 9.3 million people were diagnosed with the less common chronic bronchitis."
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers.
"Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory."
"In these systems, students progress through a series of schools."
The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education.
"An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university."
"In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education."
Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5).
"University, vocational school, college or seminary may be available after secondary school."
"A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance."
Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.
"Non-government schools, also known as private schools, may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs."
"Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi'i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements."
"Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business schools."
"Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives, of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others, of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity, and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children's natural curiosity and desire to learn.In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively."
"Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school."
"Aspen is a common name for certain tree species; some, but not all, are classified by botanists in the section Populus, of the Populus genus."
"The inventive step and non-obviousness reflect a general patentability requirement present in most patent laws, according to which an invention should be sufficiently inventive—i.e., non-obvious—in order to be patented."
"In other words, ""[the] nonobviousness principle asks whether the invention is an adequate distance beyond or above the state of the art"".The expression ""inventive step"" is predominantly used in Europe, while the expression ""non-obviousness"" is predominantly used in United States patent law."
"The expression ""inventiveness"" is sometimes used as well."
"Although the basic principle is roughly the same, the assessment of the inventive step and non-obviousness varies from one country to another."
"For instance, the practice of the European Patent Office (EPO) differs from the practice in the United Kingdom."
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
"Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals."
"The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth."
"Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts."
Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
"Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture."
"As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography."
"Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes."
"As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems."
"This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.
"The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food."
"The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the ""right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food"", as well as the ""fundamental right to be free from hunger""."
"Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 ""Zero hunger"" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030."
"Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
"There are three cuneiform (""wedge-shaped"") bones in the human foot:

the first or medial cuneiform
the second or intermediate cuneiform, also known as the middle cuneiform
the third or lateral cuneiformThey are located between the navicular bone and the first, second and third metatarsal bones and are medial to the cuboid bone."
"A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling."
The female counterpart is a sister.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full brother is a first degree relative.
A threat is a communication of intent to inflict harm or loss on another person.
Intimidation is widely observed in animal behavior (particularly in a ritualized form) chiefly in order to avoid the unnecessary physical violence that can lead to physical damage or the death of both conflicting parties.
A threat is considered an act of coercion.
Some of the more common types of threats forbidden by law are those made with an intent to obtain a monetary advantage or to compel a person to act against their will.
"In most US states, it is an offense to threaten to (1) use a deadly weapon on another person; (2) injure another's person or property; or (3) injure another's reputation."
A brigade is a major tactical military formation  that is typically composed of three to six battalions plus supporting elements.
It is roughly equivalent to an enlarged or reinforced regiment.
Two or more brigades may constitute a division.
Brigades formed into divisions are usually infantry or armored (sometimes referred to as combined arms brigades).
"In addition to combat units, they may include combat support units or sub-units, such as artillery and engineers, and logistic units."
"Historically, such brigades have sometimes been called brigade-groups."
"On operations, a brigade may comprise both organic elements and attached elements, including some temporarily attached for a specific task."
"Brigades may also be specialized and comprise battalions of a single branch, for example cavalry, mechanized, armored, artillery, air defence, aviation, engineers, signals or logistic."
Some brigades are classified as independent or separate and operate independently from the traditional division structure.
"The typical NATO standard brigade consists of approximately 3,200 to 5,500 troops."
"However, in Switzerland and Austria, the numbers could go as high as 11,000 troops."
"The Soviet Union, its forerunners and successors, mostly use ""regiment"" instead of brigade, and this was common in much of Europe until after World War II."
"A brigade's commander is commonly a major general, brigadier general, brigadier or colonel."
"In some armies, the commander is rated as a general officer."
The brigade commander has a self-contained headquarters and staff.
"The principal staff officer, usually a lieutenant colonel or colonel, may be designated chief of staff."
Until the late 20th century British and similar armies called the position 'brigade-major’ and most British brigades have a major as the chief of staff.
Some brigades may also have a deputy commander.
"The headquarters has a nucleus of staff officers and support (clerks, assistants and drivers) that can vary in size depending on the type of brigade."
"On operations, additional specialist elements may be attached."
The headquarters will usually have its own communications unit.
"In some gendarmerie forces, brigades are the basic-level organizational unit."
"In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering."
Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds.
"Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food."
"Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings."
"In common language usage, ""fruit"" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries."
"In botanical usage, the term ""fruit"" also includes many structures that are not commonly called ""fruits"", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains."
"Possession of stolen goods is a crime in which an individual has bought, been given, or acquired stolen goods."
"In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods and the good and or property is returned."
"If the individual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted."
"However, there are often exceptions, because of the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's knowledge that the goods were stolen."
Friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people.
"It is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an acquaintance or an association, such as a classmate, neighbor, or colleague."
"In some cultures, the concept of friendship is restricted to a small number of very deep relationships; in others, such as the US and Canada, a person could have many friends, plus perhaps a more intense relationship with one or two people, who may be called best friends."
"Friendship has been studied in academic fields, such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy."
"Various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles."
"Although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many such bonds."
"Such features include choosing to be with one another, enjoying time spent together, and being able to engage in a positive and supportive role to one another."
"In a religious context, sin is a transgression against divine law."
Each culture has its own interpretation of what it means to commit a sin.
"While sins are generally considered actions, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, selfish, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed ""sinful""."
Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air.
"Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye."
"Humidity indicates the likelihood for precipitation, dew, or fog to be present."
Humidity depends on the temperature and pressure of the system of interest.
The same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than warm air.
A related parameter is the dew point.
The amount of water vapor needed to achieve saturation increases as the temperature increases.
As the temperature of a parcel of air decreases it will eventually reach the saturation point without adding or losing water mass.
The amount of water vapor contained within a parcel of air can vary significantly.
"For example, a parcel of air near saturation may contain 28 g (0.99 oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 30 °C (86 °F), but only 8 g (0.28 oz) of water per cubic metre of air at 8 °C (46 °F)."
"Three primary measurements of humidity are widely employed: absolute, relative, and specific."
Absolute humidity is expressed as either mass of water vapor per volume of moist air (in grams per cubic metre) or as mass of water vapor per mass of dry air (usually in grams per kilogram).
"Relative humidity, often expressed as a percentage, indicates a present state of absolute humidity relative to a maximum humidity given the same temperature."
Specific humidity is the ratio of water vapor mass to total moist air parcel mass.
Humidity plays an important role for surface life.
"For animal life dependent on perspiration (sweating) to regulate internal body temperature, high humidity impairs heat exchange efficiency by reducing the rate of moisture evaporation from skin surfaces."
"This effect can be calculated using a heat index table, also known as a humidex."
"The notion of air ""holding"" water vapor or being ""saturated"" by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity."
"This, however, is misleading—the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is almost independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.)"
that is present.
"Indeed, a vacuum has approximately the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature."
"There is a very small difference described under ""Enhancement factor"" below, which can be neglected in many calculations unless high accuracy is required."
"The green iguana (Iguana iguana), also known as the American iguana or the common green iguana, is a large, arboreal, mostly herbivorous species of lizard of the genus Iguana."
"Usually, this animal is simply called the iguana."
"The green iguana ranges over a large geographic area; it is native from southern Brazil and Paraguay as far north as Mexico, and has been introduced from South America to Puerto Rico and is very common throughout the island, where it is colloquially known as gallina de palo (""bamboo chicken"" or ""chicken of the trees"") and considered an invasive species; in the United States, feral populations also exist in South Florida (including the Florida Keys), Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas."
"Green iguanas have also successfully colonised the island of Anguilla, arriving on the island in 1995 after rafting across the Caribbean from Guadeloupe, where they were introduced."
"A herbivore, it has adapted significantly with regard to locomotion and osmoregulation as a result of its diet."
"It grows to 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in length from head to tail, although a few specimens have grown more than 2 m (6.6 ft) with bodyweights upward of 20 lb (9.1 kg)."
"Commonly found in captivity as a pet due to its calm disposition and bright colors, it can be very demanding to care for properly."
Space requirements and the need for special lighting and heat can prove challenging to the hobbyist.
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
"Calochortus elegans is a species of flowering plant in the lily family known by the common name elegant Mariposa lily, cat's ear, elegant cat's ears or star tulip."
"It is native to the western United States from northern California to Montana.It is a perennial herb producing a slender, generally unbranched stem up to 15 centimeters in height."
The basal leaf is 10 to 20 centimeters long and does not wither at flowering.
The inflorescence bears 1 to 7 erect bell-shaped flowers.
Each flower has three sepals and three petals with very hairy inner surfaces and edges.
Each petal is greenish white in color with a purple crescent above a hairless patch at the base.
"The fruit is a winged capsule about 2 centimeters long.The bulb is a choice wild root vegetable when eaten cooked, and can be eaten raw to avoid starvation."

Facets () are flat faces on geometric shapes.
"The organization of naturally occurring facets was key to early developments in crystallography, since they reflect the underlying symmetry of the crystal structure."
Gemstones commonly have facets cut into them in order to improve their appearance by allowing them to reflect light.
"Myriopteris lanosa, the hairy lip fern, is a moderately-sized fern of the eastern United States, a member of the family Pteridaceae."
"Its leaves and stem are sparsely covered in hairs, but lack scales, hence its common name."
"One of the cheilanthoid ferns, it was usually classified in the genus Cheilanthes until 2013, when the genus Myriopteris was again recognized as separate from Cheilanthes."
"It typically grows in shallow, dry, soil, often in rocky habitats."
"A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations."
Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum total of such relationships among its constituent of members.
"In the social sciences, a larger society often exhibits stratification or dominance patterns in subgroups."
Societies construct patterns of behavior by deeming certain actions or concepts as acceptable or unacceptable.
These patterns of behavior within a given society are known as societal norms.
"Societies, and their norms, undergo gradual and perpetual changes."
"Insofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would otherwise be difficult on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap."
"A society can also consist of like-minded people governed by their own norms and values within a dominant, larger society."
"This is sometimes referred to as a subculture, a term used extensively within criminology, and also applied to distinctive subsections of a larger society."
"More broadly, and especially within structuralist thought, a society may be illustrated as an economic, social, industrial or cultural infrastructure, made up of, yet distinct from, a varied collection of individuals."
"In this regard society can mean the objective relationships people have with the material world and with other people, rather than ""other people"" beyond the individual and their familiar social environment."
A writer is a person who uses written words in different writing styles and techniques to communicate ideas.
"Writers produce different forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, books, poetry, travelogues, plays, screenplays, teleplays, songs, and essays as well as other reports and news articles that may be of interest to the general public."
Writers' texts are published across a wide range of media.
"Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well, often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society.The term ""writer"" is also used elsewhere in the arts and music – such as songwriter or a screenwriter – but as a standalone ""writer"" normally refers to the creation of written language."
Some writers work from an oral tradition.
"Writers can produce material across a number of genres, fictional or non-fictional."
"Other writers use multiple media – for example, graphics or illustration – to enhance the communication of their ideas."
"Another recent demand has been created by civil and government readers for the work of non-fictional technical writers, whose skills create understandable, interpretive documents of a practical or scientific kind."
"Some writers may use images (drawing, painting, graphics) or multimedia to augment their writing."
"In rare instances, creative writers are able to communicate their ideas via music as well as words.As well as producing their own written works, writers often write on how they write (that is, the process they use); why they write (that is, their motivation); and also comment on the work of other writers (criticism)."
"Writers work professionally or non-professionally, that is, for payment or without payment and may be paid either in advance (or on acceptance), or only after their work is published."
Payment is only one of the motivations of writers and many are not paid for their work.
"The term writer is often used as a synonym of author, although the latter term has a somewhat broader meaning and is used to convey legal responsibility for a piece of writing, even if its composition is anonymous, unknown or collaborative."
Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences.
"A variety of complex neurobiological and psychosocial factors are implicated in the development of addiction, with the predominant paradigm among researchers in the United States being the Brain Disease model, though debate exists within the field over relative contribution of any given factor."
"Classic hallmarks of addiction include impaired control over substances or behavior, preoccupation with substance or behavior, and continued use despite consequences."
"Habits and patterns associated with addiction are typically characterized by immediate gratification (short-term reward), coupled with delayed deleterious effects (long-term costs).Examples of drug and behavioral addictions include alcoholism, marijuana addiction, amphetamine addiction, cocaine addiction, nicotine addiction, opioid addiction, food addiction, chocolate addiction, video game addiction, gambling addiction, and sexual addiction."
The only behavioral addiction recognized by the DSM-5 and the ICD-10 is gambling addiction.
With the introduction of the ICD-11 gaming addiction was appended.
"The term ""addiction"" is frequently misused when referring to other compulsive behaviors or disorders, particularly dependence, in news media."
"An important distinction between drug addiction and dependence is that drug dependence is a disorder in which cessation of drug use results in an unpleasant state of withdrawal, which can lead to further drug use."
Addiction is the compulsive use of a substance or performance of a behavior that is independent of withdrawal.
"Addiction can occur in the absence of dependence, and dependence can occur in the absence of addiction, although the two often occur together."
"Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development."
"Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research."
"Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves."
"Education can take place in formal or informal settings, and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational."
The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
"Formal education is commonly divided formally into stages such as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school, and then college, university, or apprenticeship."
"In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age."
"There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies."
A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.
"Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all."
Existence is the ability of an entity to interact with physical reality.
"In philosophy, it refers to the ontological property of being."
"The National Security Agency (NSA) is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI)."
"The NSA is responsible for global monitoring, collection, and processing of information and data for foreign and domestic intelligence and counterintelligence purposes, specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence (SIGINT)."
The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U.S. communications networks and information systems.
"The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission, the majority of which are clandestine."
"The existence of the NSA was not revealed until 1975.Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II, it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S. Truman in 1952."
"Between then and the end of the Cold War, it became the largest of the U.S. intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget, but information available as of 2013 indicates that the CIA pulled ahead in this regard, with a budget of $14.7 billion."
The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end.
"The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear program."
"The NSA, alongside the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe; the CIA/NSA joint Special Collection Service (a highly classified intelligence team) inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets (such as presidential palaces or embassies)."
"SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass ""close surveillance, burglary, wiretapping, [and] breaking and entering"".Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage, the NSA does not publicly conduct human-source intelligence gathering."
"The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to, and the coordination of, SIGINT elements for other government organizations – which are prevented by law from engaging in such activities on their own."
"As part of these responsibilities, the agency has a co-located organization called the Central Security Service (CSS), which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U.S. defense cryptanalysis components."
"To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions, the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service."
"The NSA's actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions, including its spying on anti–Vietnam War leaders and the agency's participation in economic espionage."
"In 2013, the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor."
"According to the leaked documents, the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide, including United States citizens."
The documents also revealed the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people's movements using cellphones' metadata.
"Internationally, research has pointed to the NSA's ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through ""boomerang routing""."
An actor or actress (see below) is a person who portrays a character in a performance.
"The actor performs ""in the flesh"" in the traditional medium of the theatre or in modern media such as film, radio, and television."
"The analogous Greek term is ὑποκριτής (hupokritḗs), literally ""one who answers""."
"The actor's interpretation of a role—the art of acting—pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character."
"This can also be considered an ""actor's role,"" which was called this due to scrolls being used in the theaters."
"Interpretation occurs even when the actor is ""playing themselves"", as in some forms of experimental performance art."
"Formerly, in ancient Greece and the medieval world, and in England at the time of William Shakespeare, only men could become actors, and women's roles were generally played by men or boys."
"While Ancient Rome did allow female stage performers, only a small minority of them were given speaking parts."
"The commedia dell’arte of Italy, however, allowed professional women to perform early on; Lucrezia Di Siena, whose name is on a contract of actors from 10 October 1564, has been referred to as the first Italian actress known by name, with Vincenza Armani and Barbara Flaminia as the first primadonnas and the first well-documented actresses in Italy (and in Europe)."
"After the English Restoration of 1660, women began to appear onstage in England."
"In modern times, particularly in pantomime and some operas, women occasionally play the roles of boys or young men."
"A playground, playpark, or play area is a place designed to provide an environment for children that facilitates play, typically outdoors."
"While a playground is usually designed for children, some are designed for other age groups, or people with disabilities."
A playground might exclude children below a certain age.
"Modern playgrounds often have recreational equipment such as the seesaw, merry-go-round, swingset, slide, jungle gym, chin-up bars, sandbox, spring rider, trapeze rings, playhouses, and mazes, many of which help children develop physical coordination, strength, and flexibility, as well as providing recreation and enjoyment and supporting social and emotional development."
Common in modern playgrounds are play structures that link many different pieces of equipment.
"Playgrounds often also have facilities for playing informal games of adult sports, such as a baseball diamond, a skating arena, a basketball court, or a tether ball."
"Public playground equipment installed in the play areas of parks, schools, childcare facilities, institutions, multiple family dwellings, restaurants, resorts, and recreational developments, and other areas of public use."
A type of playground called a playscape is designed to provide a safe environment for play in a natural setting.
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
"Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals."
"The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth."
"Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts."
Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
"Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture."
"As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography."
"Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes."
"As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems."
"This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.
"The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food."
"The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the ""right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food"", as well as the ""fundamental right to be free from hunger""."
"Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 ""Zero hunger"" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030."
"Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation generated by the thermal motion of particles in matter.
Thermal radiation is generated when heat from the movement of charges in the material (electrons and protons in common forms of matter) is converted to electromagnetic radiation.
All matter with a temperature greater than absolute zero emits thermal radiation.
Particle motion results in charge-acceleration or dipole oscillation which produces electromagnetic radiation.
Infrared radiation emitted by animals (detectable with an infrared camera) and cosmic microwave background radiation are examples of thermal radiation.
"If a radiation object meets the physical characteristics of a black body in thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiation is called blackbody radiation."
"Planck's law describes the spectrum of blackbody radiation, which depends solely on the object's temperature."
"Wien's displacement law determines the most likely frequency of the emitted radiation, and the Stefan–Boltzmann law gives the radiant intensity.Thermal radiation is also one of the fundamental mechanisms of heat transfer."
A bracelet is an article of jewellery that is worn around the wrist.
"Bracelets may serve different uses, such as being worn as an ornament."
"When worn as ornaments, bracelets may have a supportive function to hold other items of decoration, such as charms."
"Medical and identity information are marked on some bracelets, such as allergy bracelets, hospital patient-identification tags, and bracelet tags for newborn babies."
"Bracelets may be worn to signify a certain phenomenon, such as breast cancer awareness, or for religious/cultural purposes."
"If a bracelet is a single, inflexible loop, it is often called a bangle."
When it is worn around the ankle it is called an ankle bracelet or anklet.
A boot bracelet is used to decorate boots.
"Bracelets can be manufactured from metal, leather, cloth, plastic, bead or other materials, and jewelry bracelets sometimes contain jewels, rocks, wood, shells, crystals, metal, or plastic hoops, pearls and many more materials."
The Beachy Amish Mennonites are an Anabaptist group of churches with Amish roots.
"Although they have retained the name ""Amish"" they are quite different from the common idea of Amish: they do not use horse and buggy for transportation, with a few exceptions they do not speak Pennsylvania German anymore, nor do they have restrictions on technology except for radio and television."
In the years 1946 to 1977 a majority was transformed into an evangelical revivalist denomination.
The traditionalists who wanted to preserve the old Beachy Amish ways then withdrew and formed their own congregations.
"Today they are known as Midwest Beachy Amish Mennonites or Old Beachy Amish.They form a loose association of churches without a central governing body; therefore, few common characteristics are shared by all Beachy congregations."
"Some similarities include adhering to the Dordrecht Confession of Faith and practicing varying degrees of Anabaptist practice, such as nonresistance, separation from the state, and adult baptism."
"Bull pine is a common name for several species of North American “yellow pine” trees — Genus Pinus, Section Trifoliae (“American hard pines”) — especially large, or unusually large and isolated, specimens of the following."
"Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)
Slash pine (Pinus elliottii)
Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi)
Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)
Gray pine (Pinus sabiniana)
Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)"
"Cyrus II of Persia (c. 600–530 BC; Old Persian: 𐎤𐎢𐎽𐎢𐏁, romanized: Kūruš), commonly known as Cyrus the Great and also called Cyrus the Elder by the Greeks, was the founder of the Achaemenid Empire, the first Persian empire."
"Under his rule, the empire embraced all of the previous civilized states of the ancient Near East, expanded vastly and eventually conquered most of Western Asia and much of Central Asia."
"Spanning from the Mediterranean Sea and Hellespont in the west to the Indus River in the east, the empire created by Cyrus was the largest the world had yet seen."
"At its maximum extent under his successors, the Achaemenid Empire stretched from parts of the Balkans (Eastern Bulgaria–Paeonia and Thrace–Macedonia) and Southeast Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east."
The reign of Cyrus lasted about thirty years; his empire took root with his conquest of the Median Empire followed by the Lydian Empire and eventually the Neo-Babylonian Empire.
"He also led an expedition into Central Asia, which resulted in major campaigns that were described as having brought ""into subjection every nation without exception""."
"Cyrus did not venture into Egypt, and was alleged to have died in battle while fighting the Massagetae along the Syr Darya in December 530 BC."
"However, Xenophon claimed that Cyrus did not die in battle and returned to the Achaemenid ceremonial capital of Persepolis again."
"He was succeeded by his son, Cambyses II, who managed to conquer Egypt, Nubia and Cyrenaica during his short rule."
Cyrus is well-known for having respected the customs and religions of the lands he conquered.
"He was important in developing the system of a central administration at Pasargadae governing satraps in the empire's border regions, which worked very effectively and profitably for both rulers and subjects."
"The Edict of Restoration, a proclamation attested by a cylinder seal in which Cyrus authorized and encouraged the return of the Israelites to the Land of Israel following his conquest of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, is described in the Bible and likewise left a lasting legacy on the Jewish religion due to his role in ending the Babylonian captivity and facilitating the Jewish return to Zion."
"According to Isaiah 45:1 of the Hebrew Bible, God anointed Cyrus for this task, even referring to him as a messiah (lit."
"'anointed one'); Cyrus is the only non-Jewish figure in the Bible to be revered in this capacity.Cyrus is also recognized for his achievements in human rights, politics, and military strategy, as well as his influence on both Eastern and Western civilizations."
"The Achaemenid influence in the ancient world would eventually extend as far as Athens, where upper-class Athenians adopted aspects of the culture of the ruling class of Achaemenid Persia as their own."
"Having originated from Persis, roughly corresponding to the modern-day Fars Province of Iran, Cyrus has played a crucial role in defining the national identity of modern Iran."
"He remains a cult figure amongst modern Iranians, with his tomb serving as a spot of reverence for millions of people."
"In the 1970s, the last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, identified Cyrus' famous proclamation inscribed onto the Cyrus Cylinder as the oldest-known declaration of human rights, and the Cylinder has since been popularized as such."
This view has been criticized by some Western historians as a misunderstanding of the Cylinder's generic nature as a traditional statement that new monarchs make at the beginning of their reign.
"Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia."
All living amphibians belong to the group Lissamphibia.
"They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems."
"Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this."
The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs.
Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin.
"They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed."
"With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe."
"The earliest amphibians (""crown"") evolved in the Carboniferous period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land."
"They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates."
"Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia."
"The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura (the frogs), Urodela (the salamanders), and Apoda (the caecilians)."
"The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs."
The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just 7.7 mm (0.30 in).
"The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m (30 ft) Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil."
"The study of amphibians is called batrachology, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology."
Straw is an agricultural byproduct consisting of the dry stalks of cereal plants after the grain and chaff have been removed.
"It makes up about half of the yield of cereal crops such as barley, oats, rice, rye and wheat."
"It has a number of different uses, including fuel, livestock bedding and fodder, thatching and basket making."
"Straw is usually gathered and stored in a straw bale, which is a bale, or bundle, of straw tightly bound with twine, wire, or string."
"Straw bales may be square, rectangular, or round, and can be very large, depending on the type of baler used."
"Rabbits, also known as bunnies or bunny rabbits, are small mammals in the family Leporidae (along with the hare) of the order Lagomorpha (along with the pika)."
"Oryctolagus cuniculus includes the European rabbit species and its descendants, the world's 305 breeds of domestic rabbit."
"Sylvilagus includes 13 wild rabbit species, among them the seven types of cottontail."
"The European rabbit, which has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica, is familiar throughout the world as a wild prey animal and as a domesticated form of livestock and pet."
"With its widespread effect on ecologies and cultures, the rabbit is, in many areas of the world, a part of daily life—as food, clothing, a companion, and a source of artistic inspiration."
"Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs like rabbits have been discovered to have diverged separately and earlier than their rodent cousins and have a number of traits rodents lack, like two extra incisors."
A language is a structured system of communication used by humans.
"Languages can be based on speech and gesture (spoken language), sign, or writing."
The structure of language is its grammar and the free components are its vocabulary.
"Many languages, including the most widely-spoken ones, have writing systems that enable sounds or signs to be recorded for later reactivation."
"Human language is unique among the known systems of animal communication in that it is not dependent on a single mode of transmission (sight, sound, etc."
"), is highly variable between cultures and across time, and affords a much wider range of expression than other systems.Human languages have the properties of productivity and displacement, and rely on social convention and learning."
"Estimates of the number of human languages in the world vary between 5,000 and 7,000."
Precise estimates depend on an arbitrary distinction (dichotomy) being established between languages and dialects.
"Natural languages are spoken, signed, or both; however, any language can be encoded into secondary media using auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli – for example, writing, whistling, signing, or braille."
"In other words, human language is modality-independent, but written or signed language is the way to inscribe or encode the natural human speech or gestures."
"Depending on philosophical perspectives regarding the definition of language and meaning, when used as a general concept, ""language"" may refer to the cognitive ability to learn and use systems of complex communication, or to describe the set of rules that makes up these systems, or the set of utterances that can be produced from those rules."
All languages rely on the process of semiosis to relate signs to particular meanings.
"Oral, manual and tactile languages contain a phonological system that governs how symbols are used to form sequences known as words or morphemes, and a syntactic system that governs how words and morphemes are combined to form phrases and utterances."
The scientific study of language is called linguistics.
"Critical examinations of languages, such as philosophy of language, the relationships between language and thought, etc., such as how words represent experience, have been debated at least since Gorgias and Plato in ancient Greek civilization."
"Thinkers such as Rousseau (1712 – 1778) have debated that language originated from emotions, while others like Kant (1724 –1804), have held that languages originated from rational and logical thought."
Twentieth century philosophers such as Wittgenstein (1889 – 1951) argued that philosophy is really the study of language itself.
Major figures in contemporary linguistics of these times include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.
Language is thought to have gradually diverged from earlier primate communication systems when early hominins acquired the ability to form a theory of mind and shared intentionality.
"This development is sometimes thought to have coincided with an increase in brain volume, and many linguists see the structures of language as having evolved to serve specific communicative and social functions."
"Language is processed in many different locations in the human brain, but especially in Broca's and Wernicke's areas."
"Humans acquire language through social interaction in early childhood, and children generally speak fluently by approximately three years old."
Language and culture are codependent.
"Therefore, in addition to its strictly communicative uses, language has social uses such as signifying group identity, social stratification, as well as use for social grooming and entertainment."
"Languages evolve and diversify over time, and the history of their evolution can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur."
"A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family; in contrast, a language that has been demonstrated to not have any living or non-living relationship with another language is called a language isolate."
"There are also many unclassified languages whose relationships have not been established, and spurious languages may have not existed at all."
Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken at the beginning of the 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.
"Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Karram al-Sijistani (Arabic: أبو عبد الله محمد بن كَرَّام السجستاني) was an ascetic, hellfire preacher, hadith narrator, and a literalist theologian who founded the Karramiyya sect."
"His views were considered heretical, schismatic, and abominable by the majority of Sunni scholars."
"He was accused of holding the doctrine of anthropomorphism, and that his chief theological doctrine was that God is a substance (jawhar) and that he had a body (jism); for which reason his followers were commonly called the ""Mujassima"" (corporealists) and ""Mushabbiha"" (anthropomorphists)."
"Some sources reported that he was of Arab descent, and his lineage belongs to the Bani Nizar, or Bani Turab (the people or sons of Turab), and according to some, to the Arab tribe of the Banu Nadhir."
It has been said that the sultan Mahmud al-Ghaznawi (d. 1030) was one of his followers.
"A tea cosy  or tea warmer is a cover for a teapot, traditionally made of cloth."
"It insulates a teapot, keeping the contents warm."
Their use predates the invention of vacuum flasks as a means of keeping hot liquids hot.
Tea cosies may have padded inserts that can be removed and washed.
"Some tea cosies are hand-knitted, resembling woollen hats, some even feature a ""bobble""  (pom-pom) on top, which may also serve as a handle to remove or lift the tea cosy."
"Sometimes, if the tea is served in a restaurant or in a hotel, the teapot is covered with a tea cosy that has a metal exterior to protect the inner fabric of the cosy from wear and tear and also to further improve the insulation of the teapot."
"A special tea cosy is the so-called tea lugger, which enables the hot teapot to be carried around easily."
"Tea cosies may sometimes be made in matching sets with items such as tablecloths, oven gloves, or aprons."
"Cloth tea-cosies may be embroidered, perhaps to complement a fine set of china."
"Some have been made with hidden pockets to be filled with fragrant herbs or flowers, similar to a potpourri."
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.
"For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself."
"However, 4 is composite because it is a product (2 × 2) in which both numbers are smaller than 4."
Primes are central in number theory because of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be factorized as a product of primes that is unique up to their order.
The property of being prime is called primality.
"A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  , called trial division, tests whether 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is a multiple of any integer between 2 and 
  
    
      
        
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\sqrt {n}}}
  ."
"Faster algorithms include the Miller–Rabin primality test, which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the AKS primality test, which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical."
"Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as Mersenne numbers."
"As of December 2018 the largest known prime number is a Mersenne prime with 24,862,048 decimal digits.There are infinitely many primes, as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC."
No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers.
"However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled."
"The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem, proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the probability of a randomly chosen large number being prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits, that is, to its logarithm."
Several historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved.
"These include Goldbach's conjecture, that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the twin prime conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them."
"Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers."
"Primes are used in several routines in information technology, such as public-key cryptography, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors."
"In abstract algebra, objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include prime elements and prime ideals."
"A carcinogen is any substance, radionuclide, or radiation that promotes carcinogenesis, the formation of cancer."
This may be due to the ability to damage the genome or to the disruption of cellular metabolic processes.
"Several radioactive substances are considered carcinogens, but their carcinogenic activity is attributed to the radiation, for example gamma rays and alpha particles, which they emit."
"Common examples of non-radioactive carcinogens are inhaled asbestos, certain dioxins, and tobacco smoke."
"Although the public generally associates carcinogenicity with synthetic chemicals, it is equally likely to arise in both natural and synthetic substances."
"Carcinogens are not necessarily immediately toxic; thus, their effect can be insidious."
Cancer is any disease in which normal cells are damaged and do not undergo programmed cell death as fast as they divide via mitosis.
"Carcinogens may increase the risk of cancer by altering cellular metabolism or damaging DNA directly in cells, which interferes with biological processes, and induces the uncontrolled, malignant division, ultimately leading to the formation of tumors."
"Usually, severe DNA damage leads to programmed cell death, but if the programmed cell death pathway is damaged, then the cell cannot prevent itself from becoming a cancer cell."
There are many natural carcinogens.
"Aflatoxin B1, which is produced by the fungus Aspergillus flavus growing on stored grains, nuts and peanut butter, is an example of a potent, naturally occurring microbial carcinogen."
Certain viruses such as hepatitis B and human papilloma virus have been found to cause cancer in humans.
"The first one shown to cause cancer in animals is Rous sarcoma virus, discovered in 1910 by Peyton Rous."
Other infectious organisms which cause cancer in humans include some bacteria (e.g.
Helicobacter pylori ) and helminths (e.g.
Opisthorchis viverrini  and Clonorchis sinensis).
"Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, benzene, kepone, EDB, and asbestos have all been classified as carcinogenic."
"As far back as the 1930s, Industrial smoke and tobacco smoke were identified as sources of dozens of carcinogens, including benzo[a]pyrene, tobacco-specific nitrosamines such as nitrosonornicotine, and reactive aldehydes such as formaldehyde, which is also a hazard in embalming and making plastics."
"Vinyl chloride, from which PVC is manufactured, is a carcinogen and thus a hazard in PVC production."
"Co-carcinogens are chemicals that do not necessarily cause cancer on their own, but promote the activity of other carcinogens in causing cancer."
"After the carcinogen enters the body, the body makes an attempt to eliminate it through a process called biotransformation."
The purpose of these reactions is to make the carcinogen more water-soluble so that it can be removed from the body.
"However, in some cases, these reactions can also convert a less toxic carcinogen into a more toxic carcinogen."
"DNA is nucleophilic; therefore, soluble carbon electrophiles are carcinogenic, because DNA attacks them."
"For example, some alkenes are toxicated by human enzymes to produce an electrophilic epoxide."
"DNA attacks the epoxide, and is bound permanently to it."
"This is the mechanism behind the carcinogenicity of benzo[a]pyrene in tobacco smoke, other aromatics, aflatoxin and mustard gas."
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"A sail is a tensile structure—made from fabric or other membrane materials—that uses wind power to propel sailing craft, including sailing ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice boats, and even sail-powered land vehicles."
"Sails may be made from a combination of woven materials—including canvas or polyester cloth, laminated membranes or bonded filaments—usually in a three- or four-sided shape."
"A sail provides propulsive force via a combination of lift and drag, depending on its angle of attack—its angle with respect to the apparent wind."
Apparent wind is the air velocity experienced on the moving craft and is the combined effect of the true wind velocity with the velocity of the sailing craft.
Angle of attack is often constrained by the sailing craft's orientation to the wind or point of sail.
"On points of sail where it is possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind, the  sail may act as an airfoil, generating propulsive force as air passes along its surface—just as an airplane wing generates lift—which predominates over aerodynamic drag retarding forward motion."
"The more that the angle of attack diverges from the apparent wind as a sailing craft turns downwind, the more drag increases and lift decreases as propulsive forces, until a sail going downwind is predominated by drag forces."
Sails are unable to generate propulsive force if they are aligned too closely to the wind.
"Sails may be attached to a mast, boom or other spar or may be attached to a wire that is suspended by a mast."
"They are typically raised by a line, called a halyard, and their angle with respect to the wind is usually controlled by a line, called a sheet."
"In use, they may be designed to be curved in both directions along their surface, often as a result of their curved edges."
Battens may be used to extend the trailing edge of a sail beyond the line of its attachment points.
"Other non-rotating airfoils that power sailing craft include wingsails, which are rigid wing-like structures, and kites that power kite-rigged vessels, but do not employ a mast to support the airfoil and are beyond the scope of this article."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
"Torbjørn Rødland (born 1970) is a Norwegian photographic artist, whose images are saturated with symbolism, lyricism, and eroticism."
His 2017 Serpentine Gallery solo exhibition was titled The Touch That Made You and travelled to the Fondazione Prada in Milan in 2018.
His work was shown at the Venice Biennale of 1999.
"An early retrospective was held at the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art in Oslo in 2003.Among public collections holding examples of his work are the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Fonds national d'art contemporain in Paris, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, and Moderna Museet in Stockholm."
"Marriage law refers to the legal requirements that determine the validity of a marriage, and which vary considerably among countries."
See also Marriage Act.
"A muffin top (also muffin-top) is a slang term typically used to describe a person's body fat that extends horizontally over the edges of the waistline of tightly fitting pants or skirts, visible when there is a gap between the upper and lower garment."
"The term is a reference to the way a muffin appears when it has been baked in a muffin tin, so that the top of the muffin extends horizontally over and around the top of the tin or casing."
"A law enforcement agency (LEA), in American English, is any government agency responsible for the enforcement of the laws."
"Outside the United States, such organizations are usually called police services."
"In North America, some of these services are called police, others are known as sheriff's offices/departments, while U.S. investigative police services are often called bureaus, for example the Federal Bureau of Investigation."
"Friends is an American television sitcom created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons."
"With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolves around six friends in their 20s and 30s who live in Manhattan, New York City."
"The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television."
"The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane."
Kauffman and Crane began developing Friends under the working title Insomnia Cafe between November and December 1993.
"They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC."
"After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to Six of One and Friends Like Us, the series was finally named Friends.Filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California."
The entire series ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season.
"The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth-most-watched series finale in television history and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s.Friends received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time."
"The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season."
The show ranked no.

The voltaic pile was the first electrical battery that could continuously provide an electric current to a circuit.
"It was invented by Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, who published his experiments in 1799."
"The voltaic pile then enabled a rapid series of other discoveries including the electrical decomposition (electrolysis) of water into oxygen and hydrogen by William Nicholson and Anthony Carlisle (1800) and the discovery or isolation of the chemical elements sodium (1807), potassium (1807), calcium (1808), boron (1808), barium (1808), strontium (1808), and magnesium (1808) by Humphry Davy.The entire 19th-century electrical industry was powered by batteries related to Volta's (e.g."
the Daniell cell and Grove cell) until the advent of the dynamo (the electrical generator) in the 1870s.
Volta's invention was built on Luigi Galvani's 1780s discovery of how a circuit of two metals and a frog's leg can cause the frog's leg to respond.
Volta demonstrated in 1794 that when two metals and brine-soaked cloth or cardboard are arranged in a circuit they produce an electric current.
"In 1800, Volta stacked several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs (electrodes) separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in brine (electrolyte) to increase the total electromotive force."
"When the top and bottom contacts were connected by a wire, an electric current flowed through the voltaic pile and the connecting wire."
A pocket is a bag- or envelope-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing to hold small items.
"Pockets are also  attached to luggage, backpacks, and similar items."
"In older usage, a pocket was a separate small bag or pouch."
A planet is a large astronomical body that is not a star or stellar remnant.
There are competing scientific definitions of a 'planet'.
"In the dynamicist definition adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a non-stellar body that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, that directly orbits a star, and that has cleared its orbital zone of competing objects."
"The IAU has also declared that there are eight planets in the Solar System, independently of the formal definition."
"In the geological definition used by most planetologists, a planet is a rounded sub-stellar body, possibly a satellite."
"In addition to the eight Solar planets accepted by the IAU, these include dwarf planets such as Eris and Pluto and planetary-mass moons.The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology and religion."
"Apart from the Moon, five planets are visible to the naked eye in the night sky."
Planets were regarded by many early cultures as emissaries of deities or as divine themselves.
"As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, and the invention of the telescope enabled the discovery of additional planetary objects that were diverse in size, shape and orbit."
"In 2006, the IAU adopted a resolution limiting the number of planets within the Solar System, though they are not followed by all astronomers, especially planetologists."
The IAU resolution is controversial because it excludes many geologically active objects of planetary mass due to where or what they orbit.
Ptolemy thought that the planets orbited Earth in deferent and epicycle motions.
"Although the idea that the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested before, it wasn't until the 17th century that this view was supported by the concrete evidence, in the form of telescopic observations performed by Galileo Galilei."
"About the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets' orbits were elliptical rather than circular."
"As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and that some shared such features as ice caps and seasons."
"Since the dawn of the Space Age, close observations by space probes have found that Earth and other planets share additional characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics and even hydrology."
The eight Solar planets in the IAU definition are divided into two divergent types: large low-density giant planets and small rocky terrestrial planets.
"In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars; and the four giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."
"Six are orbited by natural satellites, the two exceptions being the innermost planets Mercury and Venus."
"Under geophysical definitions, the classification is more complex: the Moon and Jupiter's moons Io and Europa are additional terrestrial planets, but a large number of small icy planets are also added, such as the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto and the other large giant-planet moons such as Ganymede, Callisto, and Titan."
"Beginning at the end of the twentieth century, several thousand planets have been discovered orbiting other stars."
"These are referred to as ""extrasolar planets"", or ""exoplanets"" for short."
"As of 1 January 2022, 4,905 extrasolar planets have been discovered in 3,629 planetary systems."
The count includes 808 multi-planetary systems.
Known exoplanets range in size from gas giants about twice as large as Jupiter down to just over the size of the Moon.
"More than 100 of these planets are approximately the size as Earth, nine of which orbit in the habitable zone of their star."
"In 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f."
"A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data, estimates a minimum of 1.6 bound planets on average for every star in the Milky Way."
"As of 2013, one in five Sun-like stars is thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone."
A star is an astronomical object consisting of a luminous spheroid of plasma held together by its own gravity.
The nearest star to Earth is the Sun.
"Many other stars are visible to the naked eye at night, but due to their immense distance from Earth they appear as fixed points of light in the sky."
"The most prominent stars have been categorised into constellations and asterisms, and many of the brightest stars have proper names."
Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations.
"The observable universe contains an estimated 1022 to 1024 stars, but most are invisible to the naked eye from Earth, including all individual stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way."
"A star's life begins with the gravitational collapse of a gaseous nebula of material composed primarily of hydrogen, along with helium and trace amounts of heavier elements."
The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate.
"For most of its active life, a star shines due to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space."
"At the end of a star's lifetime, its core becomes a stellar remnant: a white dwarf, a neutron star, or, if it is sufficiently massive, a black hole."
Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than lithium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis in stars or their remnants.
Chemically enriched material is returned to the interstellar medium by stellar mass loss or supernova explosions and then recycled into new stars.
"Astronomers can determine stellar properties including mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), variability, distance, and motion through space by carrying out observations of a star's apparent brightness, spectrum, and changes in its position on the sky over time."
"Stars can form orbital systems with other astronomical objects, as in the case of planetary systems and star systems with two or more stars."
"When two such stars have a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can have a significant impact on their evolution."
"Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy."
"A Wild Sheep Chase (羊をめぐる冒険, Hitsuji o meguru bōken) (literally An Adventure Surrounding Sheep) is the third novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami."
"First published in Japan in 1982, it was translated into English in 1989."
"It is an independent sequel to Pinball, 1973, and the third book in the so-called ""Trilogy of the Rat""."
It won the 1982 Noma Literary Newcomer's Prize.
"While the original story of A Wild Sheep Chase was set in the 1970s, translator Alfred Birnbaum and Kodansha editor Elmer Luke wanted a story that was more contemporary and also appealed to American readers."
"In the novel, Murakami blends elements of American and English literature with Japanese contexts, exploring post-WWII Japanese cultural identity."
The book is part mystery and part magical realism with a postmodern twist.
"A Wild Sheep Chase has been defined as a parody or a renewal of Yukio Mishima's Natsuko no Bōken (夏子の冒険, Natsuko's Adventure)."
The Great Imitator (also the Great Masquerader) is a phrase used for medical conditions that feature nonspecific symptoms and may be confused with a number of other diseases.
"The term connotes especially difficult differential diagnosis, especial potential for misdiagnosis, and the protean nature of some diseases."
Most great imitators are systemic in nature.
"Diseases sometimes referred to with this name include:

Various cancersIntravascular large B-cell lymphoma
Mycosis fungoides
Beriberi
Various rheumatic conditions, including:
Fibromyalgia
Psoriatic arthritis
Lupus erythematosusSystemic lupus erythematosus
Sarcoidosis
Multiple sclerosis
Celiac disease
Addison's disease
Pulmonary embolism
Various infectious diseases, including:
Syphilis
Lyme disease

Tuberculosis
Brucellosis
Infective endocarditis
Malaria
Breathing-related sleep disorders (chiefly sleep apnea/hypopnea and upper-airway resistance syndrome)

"Private equity (PE) typically refers to investment funds, generally organized as limited partnerships, that buy and restructure companies."
"More formally, private equity is a type of equity and one of the asset classes consisting of equity securities and debt in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange.A private-equity investment will generally be made by a private-equity firm, a venture capital firm or an angel investor."
"Each of these categories of investors has its own set of goals, preferences and investment strategies; however, all provide working capital to a target company to nurture expansion, new-product development, or restructuring of the company's operations, management, or ownership.Common investment strategies in private equity include leveraged buyouts, venture capital, growth capital, distressed investments and mezzanine capital."
"In a typical leveraged-buyout transaction, a private-equity firm buys majority control of an existing or mature firm."
"This is distinct from a venture-capital or growth-capital investment, in which the investors (typically venture-capital firms or angel investors) invest in young, growing or emerging companies,  but rarely obtain majority control."
"Private equity is also often grouped into a broader category called ""private capital"", generally used to describe capital supporting any long-term, illiquid investment strategy.Bloomberg Businessweek has called ""private equity"" a rebranding of leveraged-buyout firms after the 1980s.To compensate for private equities not being traded on the public market, a private equity secondary market has formed, where private equity investors purchase securities and assets from other private equity investors."
Mass is the quantity of matter in a physical body.
"It is also a measure of the body's inertia, the resistance to acceleration (change of velocity) when a net force is applied."
An object's mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies.
The SI base unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).
"In physics, mass is not the same as weight, even though mass is often determined by measuring the object's weight using a spring scale, rather than balance scale comparing it directly with known masses."
"An object on the Moon would weigh less than it does on Earth because of the lower gravity, but it would still have the same mass."
"This is because weight is a force, while mass is the property that (along with gravity) determines the strength of this force."
"A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service location in which there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or lunchroom (in American English)."
"Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from Latin American Spanish, where it had and still has the meaning ""coffeehouse""."
"Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths."
"Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray."
"In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly  items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting."
"Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table."
"For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out."
Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system.
"For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States."
Customers are either charged a flat rate for admission (as in a buffet) or pay at the check-out for each item.
Some self-service cafeterias charge by the weight of items on a patron's plate.
"In universities and colleges, some students pay for three meals a day by making a single large payment for the entire semester."
"As cafeterias require few employees, they are often found within a larger institution, catering to the clientele of that institution."
"For example, schools, colleges and their residence halls, department stores, hospitals, museums, places of worship, amusement parks, military bases, prisons, factories and office buildings often have cafeterias."
"Although some of such institutions self-operate their cafeterias, many outsource their cafeterias to a food service management company or lease space to independent businesses to operate food service facilities."
"The three largest food service management companies servicing institutions are Aramark, Compass Group, and Sodexo.At one time, upscale cafeteria-style restaurants dominated the culture of the Southern United States, and to a lesser extent the Midwest."
"There were numerous prominent chains of them: Bickford's, Morrison's Cafeteria, Piccadilly Cafeteria, S&W Cafeteria, Apple House, Luby's, K&W, Britling, Wyatt's Cafeteria and Blue Boar among them."
"Currently, two Midwestern chains still exist, Sloppy Jo's Lunchroom and Manny's, which are both located in Illinois."
"There were also a number of smaller chains, usually located in and around a single city."
"These institutions, with the exception of K&W, went into a decline in the 1960s with the rise of fast food and were largely finished off in the 1980s by the rise of all-you-can-eat buffets and other casual dining establishments."
A few chains—particularly Luby's and Piccadilly Cafeterias (which took over the Morrison's chain in 1998)—continue to fill some of the gap left by the decline of the older chains.
"Some of the smaller Midwestern chains, such as MCL Cafeterias centered on Indianapolis, are still very much in business."
The sky is the panorama obtained from observing the universe from the Earth and other celestial bodies' surface.
"In the field of astronomy, the sky is also called the celestial sphere."
"This is an abstract sphere, concentric to the Earth, on which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars appear to be drifting."
The celestial sphere is conventionally divided into designated areas called constellations.
"Usually, the term sky informally refers to a perspective from the Earth's surface; however, the meaning and usage can vary."
"An observer on the surface of the Earth can see a small part of the sky, which resembles a dome (sometimes called the sky bowl) appearing flatter during the day than at night."
"In some cases, such as in discussing the weather, the sky refers to only the lower, denser layers of the atmosphere."
The daytime sky appears blue because air molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of sunlight more than longer ones (redder light).
The night sky appears to be a mostly dark surface or region spangled with stars.
The Sun and sometimes the Moon are visible in the daytime sky unless obscured by clouds.
"At night, the Moon, planets, and stars are similarly visible in the sky."
"Some of the natural phenomena seen in the sky are clouds, rainbows, and aurorae."
Lightning and precipitation are also visible in the sky.
"Certain birds and insects, as well as human inventions like aircraft and kites, can fly in the sky."
"Due to human activities, smog during the day and light pollution during the night are often seen above large cities."
"A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain and/or squalls."
"Depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane (), typhoon (), tropical storm, cyclonic storm, tropical depression, or simply cyclone."
"A hurricane is a strong tropical cyclone that occurs in the Atlantic Ocean or northeastern Pacific Ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern Pacific Ocean; in the Indian Ocean, south Pacific, or (rarely) South Atlantic, comparable storms are referred to simply as ""tropical cyclones"", and such storms in the Indian Ocean can also be called ""severe cyclonic storms""."
"""Tropical"" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas."
"""Cyclone"" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere."
The opposite direction of circulation is due to the Coriolis effect.
Tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water.
"They derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately condenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation."
"This energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as nor'easters and European windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts."
"Tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,000 km (60 and 1,240 mi) in diameter."
"Every year tropical cyclones impact various regions of the globe including the Gulf Coast of North America, Australia, India and Bangladesh."
The strong rotating winds of a tropical cyclone are a result of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation.
"As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator."
Tropical cyclones are very rare in the South Atlantic (although occasional examples do occur) due to consistently strong wind shear and a weak Intertropical Convergence Zone.
"Conversely, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability give rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, while cyclones near Australia owe their genesis to the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool."
The primary energy source for these storms is warm ocean waters.
"These storms are therefore typically strongest when over or near water, and weaken quite rapidly over land."
"This causes coastal regions to be particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones, compared to inland regions."
"Coastal damage may be caused by strong winds and rain, high waves (due to winds), storm surges (due to wind and severe pressure changes), and the potential of spawning tornadoes."
Tropical cyclones draw in air from a large area and concentrate the water content of that air (from atmospheric moisture and moisture evaporated from water) into precipitation over a much smaller area.
"This replenishing of moisture-bearing air after rain may cause multi-hour or multi-day extremely heavy rain up to 40 kilometers (25 mi) from the coastline, far beyond the amount of water that the local atmosphere holds at any one time."
"This in turn can lead to river flooding, overland flooding, and a general overwhelming of local water control structures across a large area."
"Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones may play a role in relieving drought conditions, though this claim is disputed."
"They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it towards temperate latitudes, which plays an important role in regulating global climate."
"A phonograph disc record (also known as a gramophone disc record, especially in British English), or simply a phonograph record, gramophone record, disc record, long-playing record, or record, is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove."
The groove usually starts near the periphery and ends near the center of the disc.
"At first, the discs were commonly made from shellac, with earlier records having a fine abrasive filler mixed in."
"Starting in the 1940s polyvinyl chloride became common, hence the name ""vinyl""."
"In the mid-2000s, gradually, records made of any material began to be called vinyl disc records, also known as vinyl records or vinyl for short."
The phonograph disc record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century.
It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912.
Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed.
"By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991."
"Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres."
They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles.
"The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence as a format for rock music in the early 21st century—9.2 million records were sold in the US in 2014, a 260% increase since 2009."
"Likewise, sales in the UK increased five-fold from 2009 to 2014.As of 2017, 48 record pressing facilities remain worldwide, 18 in the US and 30 in other countries."
The increased popularity of the record has led to the investment in new and modern record-pressing machines.
"Only two producers of lacquers (acetate discs or master discs) remain: Apollo Masters in California, and MDC in Japan."
"On February 6, 2020, a fire destroyed the Apollo Masters plant."
"According to the Apollo Masters website, their future is still uncertain.Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch) (although they were designed in millimeters), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (8+1⁄3, 16+2⁄3, 33+1⁄3, 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long playing], 12-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 rpm; SP [single], 10-inch disc, 78 rpm, or 7-inch disc, 45 rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, 33+1⁄3 or 45 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc."
"); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.)."
"The phrase broken record refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.The large cover (and inner sleeves) are valued by collectors and artists for the space given for visual expression, especially in the case of 12-inch discs."
"KFC (also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken) is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky that specializes in fried chicken."
"It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019."
The chain is a subsidiary of Yum!
"Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and WingStreet chains.KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders, an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky during the Great Depression."
"Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" franchise opened in Utah in 1952."
"KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger."
"By branding himself as ""Colonel Sanders"", Harland became a prominent figure of American cultural history and his image remains widely used in KFC advertising to this day."
"However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Sanders and he sold it to a group of investors led by John Y."
Brown Jr. and Jack C. Massey in 1964.
"KFC was one of the first American fast-food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s."
"Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, it experienced mixed fortunes domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership with little or no experience in the restaurant business."
"In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R. J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate; that company sold the chain to PepsiCo."
"The chain continued to expand overseas, however, and in 1987 it became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China."
"It has since expanded rapidly in China, which is now the company's single largest market."
"PepsiCo spun off its restaurants division as Tricon Global Restaurants, which later changed its name to Yum!"
Brands.
"KFC's original product is pressure fried chicken pieces, seasoned with Sanders' recipe of 11 herbs and spices."
The constituents of the recipe are a trade secret.
"Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a cardboard ""bucket"", which has become a feature of the chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete Harman in 1957."
"Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo."
"KFC is known for its slogans ""It's Finger Lickin' Good!"
""", ""Nobody does chicken like KFC"" and ""So good""."
Conversation is interactive communication between two or more people.
The development of conversational skills and etiquette is an important part of socialization.
The development of conversational skills in a new language is a frequent focus of language teaching and learning.
"Conversation analysis is a branch of sociology which studies the structure and organization of human interaction, with a more specific focus on conversational interaction."
An office is a space where an organization's employees perform administrative work in order to support and realize objects and goals of the organization.
"The word ""office"" may also denote a position within an organization with specific duties attached to it (see officer, office-holder, official); the latter is in fact an earlier usage, office as place originally referring to the location of one's duty."
"When used as an adjective, the term ""office"" may refer to business-related tasks."
"In law, a company or organization has offices in any place where it has an official presence, even if that presence consists of (for example) a storage silo rather than an establishment with desk-and-chair."
"An office is also an architectural and design phenomenon: ranging from a small office such as a bench in the corner of a small business of extremely small size (see small office/home office), through entire floors of buildings, up to and including massive buildings dedicated entirely to one company."
In modern terms an office is usually the location where white-collar workers carry out their functions.
"According to James Stephenson, ""Office is that part of business enterprise which is devoted to the direction and co-ordination of its various activities."""
Offices in classical antiquity were often part of a palace complex or of a large temple.
"The High Middle Ages (1000–1300) saw the rise of the medieval chancery, which was usually the place where most government letters were written and where laws were copied in the administration of a kingdom."
"With the growth of large, complex organizations in the 18th century, the first purpose-built office spaces were constructed."
"As the Industrial Revolution intensified in the 18th and 19th centuries, the industries of banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and telegraphy grew dramatically, requiring many clerks, and as a result more office space was assigned to house their activities."
"The time-and-motion study, pioneered in manufacturing by F. W. Taylor (1856-1915) led to the ""Modern Efficiency Desk"" of 1915 with a flat top and drawers below, designed to allow managers an easy view of the workers."
"However, by the middle of the 20th century, it became apparent that an efficient office required discretion in the control of privacy, and gradually the cubicle system evolved.The main purpose of an office environment is to support its occupants in performing their jobs."
"Work spaces in an office are typically used for conventional office activities such as reading, writing and computer work."
"There are nine generic types of work space, each supporting different activities."
"In addition to individual cubicles, one can find meeting rooms, lounges, and spaces for support activities, such as photocopying and filing."
Some offices also have a kitchen area where workers can make their lunches.
"There are many different ways of arranging the space in an office and whilst these vary according to function, managerial fashions and the culture of specific companies can be even more important."
"While offices can be built in almost any location and in almost any building, some modern requirements for offices make this more difficult, such as requirements for light, networking, and security."
The major purpose of an office building is to provide a workplace and working environment - primarily for administrative and managerial workers.
"These workers usually occupy set areas within the office building, and usually are provided with desks, PCs and other equipment they may need within these areas."
The chief operating officer (COO) is responsible for handling administration and maintenance of an office building.
"A swimsuit is an item of clothing designed to be worn by people engaging in a water-based activity or water sports, such as swimming, diving and surfing, or sun-orientated activities, such as sun bathing."
"Different types may be worn by men, women, and children."
"A swimsuit can be described by various names, some of which are used only in particular locations, including swimwear, bathing suit, swimming costume, bathing costume, swimming suit, swimmers, swimming togs, bathers, cossie (short for ""costume""), or swimming trunks for men, besides others."
"A swimsuit can be worn as an undergarment in sports that require a wetsuit such as water skiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding."
"Swimsuits may also be worn to display the wearer's physical attributes, as in the case of beauty pageants or bodybuilding contests, and glamour photography and magazines like the annual Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue featuring models and sports personalities in swimsuits."
"There is a very wide range of styles of modern swimsuits available, which vary as to body coverage and materials."
"The choice of style may depend on community standards of modesty, as well as current fashions, and personal preferences."
"The choice will also consider the occasion, for example whether it is to be worn for a passive occasion such as sunbathing or for an activity such as surfing or swimsuit competition."
Swimwear universally cover at least the wearer′s crotch area.
"For males, swimwear today usually exposes the chest, while swimsuits for females usually cover at least the nipples, except in the case of a topless swimsuit."
"A child prodigy is defined in psychology research literature as a person who has not reached the age of puberty, who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert."
"The term is also applied more broadly to young persons who are extraordinarily talented in some field.The term Wunderkind (from German Wunderkind; literally ""wonder child"") is sometimes used as a synonym for child prodigy, particularly in media accounts."
Wunderkind also is used to recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers.
Size in general is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing.
"More specifically, geometrical size (or spatial size) can refer to linear dimensions (length, width, height, diameter, perimeter), area, or volume."
"Size can also be measured in terms of mass, especially when assuming a density range."
"In mathematical terms, ""size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by comparing a longer to a shorter""."
"Size is determined by the process of comparing or measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement."
"Such a magnitude is usually expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such as meters or inches."
"The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of anthropometry), which include measures such as human height and human body weight."
"These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes, as with the creation of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, ceiling heights, and bed sizes."
"The human experience of size can lead to a psychological tendency towards size bias, wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid."
A machine is a physical system using power to apply forces and control movement to perform an action.
"The term is commonly applied to artificial devices, such those employing engines or motors, but also to natural biological macromolecules, such as molecular machines."
"Machines can be driven by animals and people, by natural forces such as wind and water, and by chemical, thermal, or electrical power, and include a system of mechanisms that shape the actuator input to achieve a specific application of output forces and movement."
"They can also include computers and sensors that monitor performance and plan movement, often called mechanical systems."
"Renaissance natural philosophers identified six simple machines which were the elementary devices that put a load into motion, and calculated the ratio of output force to input force, known today as mechanical advantage.Modern machines are complex systems that consist of structural elements, mechanisms and control components and include interfaces for convenient use."
"Examples include: a wide range of vehicles, such as automobiles, boats and airplanes; appliances in the home and office, including computers, building air handling and water handling systems; as well as farm machinery, machine tools and factory automation systems and robots."
"Furniture refers to movable objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., Stools, Chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), and sleeping (e.g., beds, and hammocks)."
"Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers)."
Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art.
"In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose."
"It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood."
Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often reflect the local culture.
"People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites."
"Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones."
"Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne."
"The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone."
Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt.
"This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory."
"The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, with thrones being commonplace as well as the klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping."
"The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, oak, and ornamented."
Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth century.
"The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs."
The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles.
The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism.
One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.
"Oatmeal refers, to a preparation of oats that have been dehusked, steamed and flattened, or else a coarse, flour made of hulled oat grains (groats) that have either been milled (ground) or steel-cut."
"Ground oats are also called ""white oats""."
"Steel-cut oats are known as ""coarse oatmeal"", ""Irish oatmeal"" or ""pinhead oats""."
"Rolled oats were traditionally thick ""old-fashioned oats"", but can be made thinner or smaller, and may be categorized as ""quick"" or ""instant"", depending on the cooking time, which is shortened by the size of the oats and precooking."
"The term oatmeal is used to describe a common oat porridge made from ground, steel-cut, or rolled oats."
"Some commercial packages display other ingredients, such as sugar, salt, flavorings, thickeners, vitamins or minerals, while highlighting quick (""instant"") cooking and separately packaged individual portions for convenience."
Pelicans (genus Pelecanus) are a genus of large water birds that make up the family Pelecanidae.
They are characterized by a long beak and a large throat pouch used for catching prey and draining water from the scooped-up contents before swallowing.
"They have predominantly pale plumage, except for the brown and Peruvian pelicans."
"The bills, pouches, and bare facial skin of all pelicans become brightly coloured before the breeding season."
"The eight living pelican species have a patchy global distribution, ranging latitudinally from the tropics to the temperate zone, though they are absent from interior South America and from polar regions and the open ocean."
"Long thought to be related to frigatebirds, cormorants, tropicbirds, and gannets and boobies, pelicans instead are now known to be most closely related to the shoebill and hamerkop, and are placed in the order Pelecaniformes."
"Ibises, spoonbills, herons, and bitterns have been classified in the same order."
Fossil evidence of pelicans dates back at least 30 million years to the remains of a beak very similar to that of modern species recovered from Oligocene strata in France.
They are thought to have evolved in the Old World and spread into the Americas; this is reflected in the relationships within the genus as the eight species divide into Old World and New World lineages.
"Pelicans frequent inland and coastal waters, where they feed principally on fish, catching them at or near the water surface."
"They are gregarious birds, travelling in flocks, hunting cooperatively, and breeding colonially."
"Four white-plumaged species tend to nest on the ground, and four brown or grey-plumaged species nest mainly in trees."
The relationship between pelicans and people has often been contentious.
The birds have been persecuted because of their perceived competition with commercial and recreational fishing.
"Their populations have fallen through habitat destruction, disturbance, and environmental pollution, and three species are of conservation concern."
"They also have a long history of cultural significance in mythology, and in Christian and heraldic iconography."
Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are birds that are adapted to life within the marine environment.
"While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking convergent evolution, as the same environmental problems and feeding niches have resulted in similar adaptations."
"The first seabirds evolved in the Cretaceous period, and modern seabird families emerged in the Paleogene."
"In general, seabirds live longer, breed later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young."
"Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions."
"Many species are famous for undertaking long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases."
"They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other."
"Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely."
"Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to hunters, guided fishermen to fishing stocks and led sailors to land."
"Many species are currently threatened by human activities, such as from oil spills, getting trapped in nets, and by climate change and severe weather."
Conservation efforts include the establishment of wildlife refugees and adjustments to fishing techniques.
"Trousers (British English), slacks, or pants are an item of clothing that might have originated in Central Asia, worn from the waist to the ankles, covering both legs separately (rather than with cloth extending across both legs as in robes, skirts, and dresses)."
"In the United Kingdom, the word pants generally means underwear and not trousers."
"Shorts are similar to trousers, but with legs that come down only to around the area of the knee, higher or lower depending on the style of the garment."
"To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called ""long trousers"" in certain contexts such as school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called ""short trousers"" in the UK."
"The oldest known trousers were found at the Yanghai cemetery in Turpan, Sinkiang (Tocharia), in present-day western China, it's been dated to the period between the 10th and the 13th centuries BC."
"Made of wool, the trousers had straight legs and wide crotches and were likely made for horseback riding.In most of Europe, trousers have been worn since ancient times and throughout the Medieval period, becoming the most common form of lower-body clothing for adult males in the modern world."
Breeches were worn instead of trousers in early modern Europe by some men in higher classes of society.
Distinctive formal trousers are traditionally worn with formal and semi-formal day attire.
"Since the mid-20th century, trousers have increasingly been worn by women as well."
"Jeans, made of denim, are a form of trousers for casual wear widely worn all over the world by both sexes."
Shorts are often preferred in hot weather or for some sports and also often by children and adolescents.
"Trousers are worn on the hips or waist and are often held up by buttons, elastic, a belt or suspenders (braces)."
"Unless elastic, and especially for men, trousers usually provide a zippered or buttoned fly."
Jeans usually feature side and rear pockets with pocket openings placed slightly below the waist band.
It is also possible for trousers to provide cargo pockets further down the legs.
Maintenance of fit is more challenging for trousers than for some other garments.
"Leg-length can be adjusted with a hem, which helps to retain fit during the adolescent and early adulthood growth years."
"Tailoring adjustment of girth to accommodate weight gain or weight loss is relatively limited, and otherwise serviceable trousers may need to be replaced after a significant change in body composition."
"Higher quality trousers often have extra fabric included in the centre-back seam allowance, so the waist can be let out further."
"In international relations, aid (also known as international aid, overseas aid, foreign aid, economic aid or foreign assistance) is – from the perspective of governments – a voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another."
"Aid may serve one or more functions: it may be given as a signal of diplomatic approval, or to strengthen a military ally, to reward a government for behavior desired by the donor, to extend the donor's cultural influence, to provide infrastructure needed by the donor for resource extraction from the recipient country, or to gain other kinds of commercial access."
Countries may provide aid for further diplomatic reasons.
"Humanitarian and altruistic purposes are often reasons for foreign assistance.Aid may be given by individuals, private organizations, or governments."
"Standards delimiting exactly the types of transfers considered ""aid"" vary from country to country."
"For example, the United States government discontinued the reporting of military aid as part of its foreign aid figures in 1958."
"The most widely used measure of aid is ""Official Development Assistance"" (ODA)."
Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD; also magneto-fluid dynamics or hydro­magnetics) is the study of the magnetic properties and behaviour of electrically conducting fluids.
"Examples of such magneto­fluids include plasmas, liquid metals, salt water, and electrolytes."
"The word ""magneto­hydro­dynamics"" is derived from magneto- meaning magnetic field, hydro- meaning water, and dynamics meaning movement."
"The field of MHD was initiated by Hannes Alfvén, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1970."
"The fundamental concept behind MHD is that magnetic fields can induce currents in a moving conductive fluid, which in turn polarizes the fluid and reciprocally changes the magnetic field itself."
The set of equations that describe MHD are a combination of the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and Maxwell’s equations of electro­magnetism.
"These differential equations must be solved simultaneously, either analytically or numerically."
"An oil is any nonpolar chemical substance that is composed primarily of hydrocarbons and is both hydrophobic (does not mix with water, literally ""water fearing"") and lipophilic (mixes with other oils, literally ""fat loving"")."
Oils are usually flammable and surface active.
Most oils are unsaturated lipids that are liquid at room temperature.
"The general definition of oil includes classes of chemical compounds that may be otherwise unrelated in structure, properties, and uses."
"Oils may be animal, vegetable, or petrochemical in origin, and may be volatile or non-volatile."
"They are used for food (e.g., olive oil), fuel (e.g., heating oil), medical purposes (e.g., mineral oil), lubrication (e.g."
"motor oil), and the manufacture of many types of paints, plastics, and other materials."
Specially prepared oils are used in some religious ceremonies and rituals as purifying agents.
"Cuba ( (listen) KEW-bə, Spanish: [ˈkuβa] (listen)), officially the Republic of Cuba (Spanish: República de Cuba [reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkuβa] (listen)), is a country comprising the island of Cuba, as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos."
"Cuba is located where the northern Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Atlantic Ocean meet."
"Cuba is located at the east of the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico), south of both the American state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic), and north of both Jamaica and the Cayman Islands."
Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey.
"The official area of the Republic of Cuba is 109,884 km2 (42,426 sq mi) (without the territorial waters)."
"The main island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean, with an area of 104,556 km2 (40,369 sq mi)."
"Cuba is the second-most populous country in the Caribbean after Haiti, with over 11 million inhabitants.The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century."
"From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a de facto United States protectorate in 1902."
"As a fragile republic, in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952."
"Open corruption and oppression under Batista's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro."
"Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba."
"The country was a point of contention during the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States, and a nuclear war nearly broke out during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962."
"Cuba is one of a few extant Marxist–Leninist socialist states, where the role of the vanguard Communist Party is enshrined in the Constitution."
"Under Castro, Cuba was involved in a broad range of military and humanitarian activities throughout both Africa and Asia.Culturally, Cuba is considered part of Latin America."
"It is a multiethnic country whose people, culture and customs derive from diverse origins, including the Taíno Ciboney peoples, the long period of Spanish colonialism, the introduction of enslaved Africans and a close relationship with the Soviet Union in the Cold War."
"Cuba is a founding member of the United Nations, the G77, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States, ALBA and the Organization of American States."
"It has currently one of the world's only planned economies, and its economy is dominated by the tourism industry and the exports of skilled labor, sugar, tobacco, and coffee."
"Cuba has historically – both before and during Communist rule – performed better than other countries in the region on several socioeconomic indicators, such as literacy, infant mortality and life expectancy.Cuba has a single-party authoritarian regime where political opposition is not permitted."
"There are elections in Cuba, but they are not considered democratic."
"Censorship of information (including limits to internet access) is extensive, and independent journalism is repressed in Cuba; Reporters Without Borders has characterized Cuba as one of the worst countries in the world for press freedom."
"Produce is a generalized term for many farm-produced crops, including fruits and vegetables (grains, oats, etc."
are also sometimes considered produce).
"More specifically, the term produce often implies that the products are fresh and generally in the same state as where and when they were harvested."
"In supermarkets, the term is also used to refer to the section of the store where fruit and vegetables are kept."
"Produce is the main product sold by greengrocers (UK, Australia) and farmers' markets."
"The term is widely and commonly used in the U.S. and Canada, but is not typically used outside the agricultural sector in other English-speaking countries."
"In parts of the world, including the U.S., produce is marked with small stickers bearing price look-up codes."
These four- or five-digit codes are a standardized system intended to aid checkout and inventory control at places where produce is sold.
Letterkenny is a Canadian comedy television series created by Jared Keeso and developed by Keeso and Jacob Tierney.
"The series' first season premiered on CraveTV on February 7, 2016."
"Throughout its run, the series has featured a variety of actors in both long-term lead roles and inconsistent supporting appearances."
Nineteen cast members have appeared in every season.
"The pilot episode opens with the text ""Letterkenny consists of hicks, skids, hockey players and Christians."
"These are their problems."""
"While the latter group was phased out early on, the structure of the show revolves around the other three groups of characters."
"A government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, generally a state."
"In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary."
"Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy."
"In many countries, the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy."
"While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations."
"Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy and tyranny."
"The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession."
The giraffe is a tall African mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
"Specifically, It is an even-toed ungulate."
It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
"Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies."
"Most recently, researchers proposed dividing giraffes into up to eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements."
Seven other extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
"The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat patterns."
"It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi."
"Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east."
Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands.
"Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach."
"Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes."
"Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations."
"Males establish social hierarchies through ""necking,” which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon."
"Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young."
"The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance, and has often been featured in paintings, books, and cartoons."
It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction and has been extirpated from many parts of its former range.
"Giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild."
"More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010."
"A guide is a person who leads travelers, sportsmen, or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations."
The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.
Observation is the active acquisition of information from a primary source.
"In living beings, observation employs the senses."
"In science, observation can also involve the perception and recording of data via the use of scientific instruments."
The term may also refer to any data collected during the scientific activity.
"Observations can be qualitative, that is, only the absence or presence of a property is noted, or quantitative if a numerical value is attached to the observed phenomenon by counting or measuring."
"The apostrophe (' or ’) is a punctuation mark, and sometimes a diacritical mark, in languages that use the Latin alphabet and some other alphabets."
"In English, the apostrophe is used for three basic purposes:

The marking of the omission of one or more letters, e.g."
"the contraction of ""do not"" to ""don't""."
"The marking of possessive case of nouns (as in ""the eagle's feathers"", ""in one month's time"", ""at your parents'‌ [home]"")."
"The marking of plurals in a few distinctive cases, e.g."
"""p's and q's"" or Oakland A's.The word ""apostrophe"" comes ultimately from Greek ἡ ἀπόστροφος [προσῳδία] (hē apóstrophos [prosōidía], '[the accent of] turning away or elision'), through Latin and French.For use in computer systems, Unicode has code points for three different forms of apostrophe."
A man is an adult male human.
"Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a boy (a male child or adolescent)."
"Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father."
Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.
"During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes."
"These include greater muscle mass, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition."
"Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the penis, testicles, sperm duct, prostate gland and the epididymis, as well as secondary sex characteristics."
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment.
"It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about."
"A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick."
"Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic."
"Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata)."
"The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction."
"Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass."
"Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets."
"A curtain is a piece of cloth or other material intended to block or obscure light, air drafts, or (in the case of a shower curtain), water."
A curtain is also the movable screen or drape in a theater that separates the stage from the auditorium or that serves as a backdrop/background.Curtains are often hung on the inside of a building's windows to block the passage of light.
"For instance, at night to aid sleeping, or to stop light from escaping outside the building (stopping people outside from being able to see inside, often for privacy reasons)."
"In this application, they are also known as ""draperies""."
Curtains hung over a doorway are known as portières.
"Curtains come in a variety of shapes, materials, sizes, colors, and patterns."
"They often have their own sections within department stores, while some shops are completely dedicated to selling curtains."
"Curtains vary according to cleanability, ultraviolet light deterioration, oil and dust retention, noise absorption, fire resistance, and life span."
"Curtains may be operated by hand, with cords, by press-button pads or remote-controlled computers."
They are held out of the way of the window by means of curtain tie-backs.
"Measuring curtain sizes needed for each window varies greatly according to the type of curtain needed, window size, and type and weight of curtain."
Curtains are a form of window treatment and complete the overall appearance of the interior of the house.
Window treatment helps control the ambiance and flow of natural light into the room.
"The effect of drapery or curtains is best seen in daylight, and with proper indoor light positioning, can look attractive even at night."
"Religion is usually defined as a social-cultural system of designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements; however, there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion.Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacred things, faith, a supernatural being or supernatural beings or ""some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life""."
"Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities and/or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture."
"Religions have sacred histories and narratives, which may be preserved in sacred scriptures, and symbols and holy places, that aim mostly to give a meaning to life."
"Religions may contain symbolic stories, which are sometimes said by followers to be true, that may also attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena."
"Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs.There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide."
"About 84% of the world's population is affiliated with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, or some form of folk religion."
"The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics."
"While the religiously unaffiliated have grown globally, many of the religiously unaffiliated still have various religious beliefs.The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, comparative religion and social scientific studies."
"Theories of religion offer various explanations for the origins and workings of religion, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief."
A dress (also known as a frock or a gown) is a garment traditionally worn by women or girls consisting of a skirt with an attached bodice (or a matching bodice giving the effect of a one-piece garment).
It consists of a top piece that covers the torso and hangs down over the legs.
"A dress can be any one-piece garment containing a skirt of any length, and can be formal or casual."
"A dress can have sleeves, straps, or be held up with elastic around the chest, leaving the shoulders bare."
Dresses also vary in color.
"The hemlines of dresses vary depending on modesty, weather, fashion or the personal taste of the wearer."
"Working capital (abbreviated WC) is a financial metric which represents operating liquidity available to a business, organization, or other entity, including governmental entities."
"Along with fixed assets such as plant and equipment, working capital is considered a part of operating capital."
Gross working capital is equal to current assets.
Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities.
"If current assets are less than current liabilities, an entity has a working capital deficiency, also called a working capital deficit and Negative Working capital."
A company can be endowed with assets and profitability but may fall short of liquidity if its assets cannot be readily converted into cash.
Positive working capital is required to ensure that a firm is able to continue its operations and that it has sufficient funds to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses.
"The management of working capital involves managing inventories, accounts receivable and payable, and cash."
"One of the basic pieces of furniture, a chair is a type of seat."
"Its primary features are two pieces of a durable material, attached as back and seat to one another at a 90°-or-slightly-greater angle, with usually the four corners of the horizontal seat attached in turn to four legs—or other parts of the seat's underside attached to three legs or to a shaft about which a four-arm turnstile on rollers can turn—strong enough to support the weight of a person who sits on the seat (usually wide and broad enough to hold the lower body from the buttocks almost to the knees) and leans against the vertical back (usually high and wide enough to support the back to the shoulder blades)."
The legs are typically high enough for the seated person's thighs and knees to form a 90°-or-lesser angle.
Used in a number of rooms in homes (e.g.
"in living rooms, dining rooms, and dens), in schools and offices (with desks), and in various other workplaces, chairs may be made of wood, metal, or synthetic materials, and either the seat alone or the entire chair may be padded or upholstered in various colors and fabrics."
Chairs vary in design.
An armchair has armrests fixed to the seat; a recliner is upholstered and under its seat is a mechanism that allows one to lower the chair's back and raise into place a fold-out footrest; a rocking chair has legs fixed to two long curved slats; and a wheelchair has wheels fixed to an axis under the seat.
A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases energy as thermal energy or to be used for work.
The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).
The heat energy released by reactions of fuels can be converted into mechanical energy via a heat engine.
"Other times the heat itself is valued for warmth, cooking, or industrial processes, as well as the illumination that accompanies combustion."
"Fuels are also used in the cells of organisms in a process known as cellular respiration, where organic molecules are oxidized to release usable energy."
"Hydrocarbons and related organic molecules are by far the most common source of fuel used by humans, but other substances, including radioactive metals, are also utilized."
"Fuels are contrasted with other substances or devices storing potential energy, such as those that directly release electrical energy (such as batteries and capacitors) or mechanical energy (such as flywheels, springs, compressed air, or water in a reservoir)."
A baker is a tradesperson who bakes and sometimes sells breads and other products made of flour by using an oven or other concentrated heat source.
The place where a baker works is called a bakery.
"A suburb (or suburban area or suburbia) is a commercial, mixed-use or residential area."
It can exist either as part of a city/urban area and can often have a large degree of employment.
In some metropolitan areas they exist as separate residential communities within commuting distance of a city.
"Suburbs might have their own political or legal jurisdiction, especially in the United States, but this is not always the case, especially in the United Kingdom where most suburbs are located within the administrative boundaries of cities."
"In most English-speaking countries, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, suburb has become largely synonymous with what is called a ""neighborhood"" in other countries, and the term encompasses inner city areas.In some areas, such as Australia, India, China, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom, and parts of the United States, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities due to urban sprawl."
"In others, such as Morocco, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed locally as part of a larger metropolitan area such as a county, district or borough."
"In the United States, regions beyond the suburbs are exurbs or ""exurban areas"", with less population density (but still more than rural areas) but linked to the metropolitan area economically, particularly by commuters."
"Suburbs first emerged on a large scale in the 19th and 20th centuries as a result of improved rail and road transport, which led to an increase in commuting."
"In general, they are less densely populated than inner city neighborhoods within the same metropolitan area, and most residents routinely commute to city centers or business districts via private vehicles or public transits; however, there are many exceptions, including industrial suburbs, planned communities and satellite cities."
Suburbs tend to proliferate around cities that have an abundance of adjacent flat land.
"A bridge is a structure built to span a physical obstacle (such as a body of water, valley, road, or rail) without blocking the way underneath."
"It is constructed for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle, which is usually something that is otherwise difficult or impossible to cross."
"There are many different designs of bridges, each serving a particular purpose and applicable to different situations."
"Designs of bridges vary depending on factors such as the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed and anchored, and the material used to make it, and the funds available to build it."
The earliest bridges were likely made with fallen trees and stepping stones.
The Neolithic people built boardwalk bridges across marshland.
"The Arkadiko Bridge (dating from the 13th century BC, in the Peloponnese) is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use."
Jelly beans are small bean-shaped sugar candies with soft candy shells and thick gel interiors (see gelatin and jelly).
The confection is primarily made of sugar and sold in a wide variety of colors and flavors.
An uncle is usually defined as a male relative who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent.
Uncles who are related by birth are second-degree relatives.
"The female counterpart of an uncle is an aunt, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece."
"The word comes from Latin: avunculus, the diminutive of avus (grandfather), and is a family relationship within an extended or imediate family."
"In some cultures and families,  children may refer to the cousins of their parents as uncle (or aunt)."
"It is also used as a title of respect for older relatives, neighbours, acquaintances, family friends, and even total strangers in some cultures, for example Aboriginal Australian elders."
Using the term in this way is a form of fictive kinship.
Any social institution where a special relationship exists between a man and his sisters' children is known as an avunculate (or avunculism or avuncularism).
"This relationship can be formal or informal, depending on the society."
"Early anthropological research focused on the association between the avunculate and matrilineal descent, while later research has expanded to consider the avunculate in general society."
"In architecture, a hall is a relatively large space enclosed by a roof and walls."
"In the Iron Age and early Middle Ages in northern Europe, a mead hall was where a lord and his retainers ate and also slept."
"Later in the Middle Ages, the great hall was the largest room in castles and large houses, and where the servants usually slept."
"As more complex house plans developed, the hall remained a large room for dancing and large feasts, often still with servants sleeping there."
It was usually immediately inside the main door.
"In modern British houses, an entrance hall next to the front door remains an indispensable feature, even if it is essentially merely a corridor."
"Today, the (entrance) hall of a house is the space next to the front door or vestibule leading to the rooms directly and/or indirectly."
"Where the hall inside the front door of a house is elongated, it may be called a passage, corridor (from Spanish corredor used in El Escorial and 100 years later in Castle Howard), or hallway."
A trust is a legal relationship in which the holder of a right gives it to another person or entity who must keep and use it solely for another's benefit.
"In Anglo-American common law, the party who entrusts the right is known as the ""settlor"", the party to whom the right is entrusted is known as the ""trustee"", the party for whose benefit the property is entrusted is known as the ""beneficiary"", and the entrusted property itself is known as the ""corpus"" or ""trust property""."
"With the strategic and legal use of Trusts, individuals can ensure that their children and grandchildren or chosen beneficiaries are able to benefit completely from the inheritance they want them to receive."
A testamentary trust is created by a will and arises after the death of the settlor.
An inter vivos trust is created during the settlor's lifetime by a trust instrument.
"A trust may be revocable or irrevocable; in the United States, a trust is presumed to be irrevocable unless the instrument or will creating it states it is revocable, except in Pennsylvania, California, Oklahoma and Texas (and any other state that has adopted section 602 of the Uniform Trust Code), in which trusts are presumed to be revocable unless the instrument or will creating them states they are irrevocable."
"An irrevocable trust can be ""broken"" (revoked) only by a judicial proceeding."
"The trustee is the legal owner of the property in trust, as fiduciary for the beneficiary or beneficiaries who is/are the equitable owner(s) of the trust property."
Trustees thus have a fiduciary duty to manage the trust to the benefit of the equitable owners.
They must provide a regular accounting of trust income and expenditures.
Trustees may be compensated and be reimbursed their expenses.
A court of competent jurisdiction can remove a trustee who breaches their fiduciary duty.
Some breaches of fiduciary duty can be charged and tried as criminal offenses in a court of law.
"A trustee can be a natural person, a business entity or a public body."
A trust in the United States may be subject to federal and state taxation.
"A trust is created by a settlor, who transfers title to some or all of his or her property to a trustee, who then holds title to that property in trust for the benefit of the beneficiaries."
The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created.
"In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed."
"It is possible for a single individual to assume the role of more than one of these parties, and for multiple individuals to share a single role."
"For example, in a living trust it is common for the grantor to be both a trustee and a lifetime beneficiary while naming other contingent beneficiaries.Trusts have existed since Roman times and have become one of the most important innovations in property law."
"Trust law has evolved through court rulings differently in different states, so statements in this article are generalizations; understanding the jurisdiction-specific case law involved is tricky."
"Some U.S. states are adapting the Uniform Trust Code to codify and harmonize their trust laws, but state-specific variations still remain."
"An owner placing property into trust turns over part of his or her bundle of rights to the trustee, separating the property's legal ownership and control from its equitable ownership and benefits."
"This may be done for tax reasons or to control the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or deceased."
"Testamentary trusts may be created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries."
"While the trustee is given legal title to the trust property, in accepting title the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries."
"The primary duties owed are those of loyalty, prudence and impartiality."
Trustees may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings to enforce their behavior.
"To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject to a number of ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including duties of openness and transparency, and duties of recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure."
"In addition, a trustee has a duty to know, understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law."
"The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties and neither endebt nor riskily speculate on the trust assets without the written, clear permission of all of the adult beneficiaries."
There are strong restrictions regarding a trustee with a conflict of interest.
"Courts can reverse a trustee's actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions if they find a trustee has failed in any of his or her duties."
Such a failure is a civil breach of trust and can leave a neglectful or dishonest trustee with severe liabilities for the breach.
It is highly advisable for settlors and in many cases trustees to seek qualified legal counsel (advice) before entering into or creating a trust agreement and trustees must take great care in acting or omitting to act to avoid unlawful mistakes.
"Palm wine, known by several local names, is an alcoholic beverage created from the sap of various species of palm tree such as the palmyra, date palms, and coconut palms."
"It is known by various names in different regions and is common in various parts of Africa, the Caribbean, South America, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Micronesia."
Palm wine production by smallholders and individual farmers may promote conservation as palm trees become a source of regular household income that may economically be worth more than the value of timber sold.
"A pendulum clock is a clock that uses a pendulum, a swinging weight, as its timekeeping element."
"The advantage of a pendulum for timekeeping is that it is a harmonic oscillator: It swings back and forth in a precise time interval dependent on its length, and resists swinging at other rates."
"From its invention in 1656 by Christiaan Huygens, inspired by Galileo Galilei, until the 1930s, the pendulum clock was the world's most precise timekeeper, accounting for its widespread use."
"Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, pendulum clocks in homes, factories, offices, and railroad stations served as primary time standards for scheduling daily life, work shifts, and public transportation."
Their greater accuracy allowed for the faster pace of life which was necessary for the Industrial Revolution.
"The home pendulum clock was replaced by less-expensive, synchronous, electric clocks in the 1930s and '40s."
Pendulum clocks are now kept mostly for their decorative and antique value.
Pendulum clocks must be stationary to operate.
"Any motion or accelerations will affect the motion of the pendulum, causing inaccuracies, thus necessitating other mechanisms for use in portable timepieces."
"Arithmetic (from the Greek ἀριθμός arithmos, 'number' and τική [τέχνη], tiké [téchne], 'art' or 'craft') is a branch of mathematics that consists of the study of numbers, especially concerning the properties of the traditional operations on them—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and extraction of roots."
"Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis."
"The terms arithmetic and higher arithmetic were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for number theory, and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory."
"Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, grain alcohol, drinking alcohol, or simply alcohol) is an organic chemical compound."
It is a simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H6O.
"Its formula can be also written as CH3−CH2−OH or C2H5OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH."
"Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a characteristic wine-like odor and pungent taste."
"It is a psychoactive drug, recreational drug, and the active ingredient in alcoholic drinks."
Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes such as ethylene hydration.
It has medical applications as an antiseptic and disinfectant.
It is used as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds.
Ethanol is a fuel source.
Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae.
"They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans."
"Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere."
"Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia."
"Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails."
"While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets."
"With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals."
They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell.
"Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers."
"Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days."
"Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance."
"With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies."
"In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market."
"The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries."
"The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing."
"Flight or flying is the process by which an object moves through a space without contacting any planetary surface, either within an atmosphere (i.e."
air flight or aviation) or through the vacuum of outer space (i.e.
spaceflight).
"This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift associated with gliding or propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement."
"Many things can fly, from animal aviators such as birds, bats and insects, to natural gliders/parachuters such as patagial animals, anemochorous seeds and ballistospores, to human inventions like aircraft (airplanes, helicopters, airships, balloons, etc.)"
and rockets which may propel spacecraft and spaceplanes.
"The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the atmosphere, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles."
"Bees are insects with wings closely related to wasps and ants, known for their role in pollination and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the western honey bee, for producing honey."
Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea.
"They are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila."
"There are over 16,000 known species of bees in seven recognized biological families."
"Some species – including honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees – live socially in colonies while most species (>90%) – including mason bees, carpenter bees, leafcutter bees, and sweat bees – are solitary."
"Bees are found on every continent except for Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated flowering plants."
"The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the Halictidae, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies."
"Bees range in size from tiny stingless bee species, whose workers are less than 2 millimetres (0.08 in) long, to Megachile pluto, the largest species of leafcutter bee, whose females can attain a length of 39 millimetres (1.54 in)."
"Bees feed on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for protein and other nutrients."
Most pollen is used as food for their larvae.
Vertebrate predators of bees include primates and birds such as bee-eaters; insect predators include beewolves and dragonflies.
"Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially, and the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees."
"The analysis of 353 wild bee and hoverfly species across Britain from 1980 to 2013 found the insects have been lost from a quarter of the places they inhabited in 1980.Human beekeeping or apiculture (meliponiculture for stingless bees) has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece."
"Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature from ancient times to the present day, although primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere where beekeeping is far more common."
"In Mesoamerica, the Mayans have practiced large-scale intensive meliponiculture since pre-Columbian times."
A boy is a young male human.
The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent.
"When a male human reaches adulthood, he is described as a man."
The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena.
Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves.
"These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation."
"They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion."
Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed.
"Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent."
Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals.
Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed.
Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states.
Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind.
"According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental."
"For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play."
"Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition."
"Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality."
The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem.
"Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical."
"Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters."
Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).
"For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines."
"Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions."
Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g.
"panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities."
"Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers."
"Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind."
"The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind."
The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.
"Red currant may refer to:

Ribes rubrum, a shrub native to western Europe and widely cultivated
Ribes sanguineum, a shrub native to North America
Searsia chirindensis a tree native to southern Africa"
A plough or plow (US; both ) is a farm tool for loosening or turning the soil before sowing seed or planting.
"Ploughs were traditionally drawn by oxen and horses, but in modern farms are drawn by tractors."
"A plough may have a wooden, iron or steel frame, with a blade attached to cut and loosen the soil."
It has been fundamental to farming for most of history.
The earliest ploughs had no wheels; such a plough was known to the Romans as an aratrum.
"Celtic peoples first came to use wheeled ploughs in the Roman era.The prime purpose of ploughing is to turn over the uppermost soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface while burying weeds and crop remains to decay."
Trenches cut by the plough are called furrows.
"In modern use, a ploughed field is normally left to dry and then harrowed before planting."
"Ploughing and cultivating soil evens the content of the upper 12 to 25 centimetres (5 to 10 in) layer of soil, where most plant-feeder roots grow."
"Ploughs were initially powered by humans, but the use of farm animals was considerably more efficient."
The earliest animals worked were oxen.
"Later, horses and mules were used in many areas."
With the industrial revolution came the possibility of steam engines to pull ploughs.
These in turn were superseded by internal-combustion-powered tractors in the early 20th century.
Use of the traditional plough has decreased in some areas threatened by soil damage and erosion.
Used instead is shallower ploughing or other less-invasive conservation tillage.
"An award, sometimes called a distinction, is something given to a recipient as a token of recognition of excellence in a certain field."
"When the token is a medal, ribbon or other item designed for wearing, it is known as a decoration."
"An award may be described by three aspects: 1) who is given 2) what 3) by whom, all varying according to purpose."
"The recipient is often to a single person, such as a student or athlete, or a representative of a group of people, be it an organisation, a sports team or a whole country."
"The award item may be a decoration, that is an insignia suitable for wearing, such as a medal, badge, or rosette (award)."
"It can also be a token object such as certificate, diploma, championship belt, trophy, or plaque."
"The award may also be or be accompanied by a title of honor, as well as an object of direct value such as prize money or a scholarship."
"Furthermore, an honorable mention is an award given, typically in education, that does not confer the recipient(s) a higher standing but is considered worth mentioning in an honourable way."
"An award may be conferred as a state decoration by sovereign state, dynasty or other public authority (see fount of honour), or else a private organisation or individual."
"The latter may also include ecclesiastical authorities, such as in the case of ecclesiastical awards."
"For example, the Nobel Prize recognizes contributions to society, while the Pulitzer prize honors literary achievements."
"An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize."
"Awards for sports tournaments often take the form of cups, following a tradition harking back to the ancient Greek tripod given to winners in athletic contests."
The Stanley Cup is a modern example.
"In contrast, awards for employee recognition often take the form of plaques or crystal pieces."
An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient.
"Finally, an award may recognize participation rather than victory."
"There is controversy regarding the appropriateness of participation awards for students in United States schools.A relative field to awards is phaleristics, an auxiliary science of history and numismatics which studies orders, fraternities and award items, such as medals and other decorations."
"A home, or domicile, is a space used as a permanent or semi-permanent residence for one or many humans."
It is a fully or semi sheltered space and can have both interior and exterior aspects to it.
"Homes provide sheltered spaces for instance rooms, where domestic activity can be performed such as sleeping, preparing food, eating and hygiene as well as providing spaces for work and leisure such as remote working, studying and playing."
"Physical forms of homes can be static such as a house or an apartment, mobile such as a houseboat, trailer or yurt or digital such as virtual space."
"The aspect of ‘home’ can be considered across scales, from the microscale showcasing the most intimate spaces of the individual dwelling and direct surrounding area to the macro scale of the geographic area such as town, village, city, country or planet."
"The concept of ‘home’ has been researched and theorized across disciplines - topics ranging from the idea of home, the interior, the psyche, liminal space, contested space to gender and politics."
The home as a concept expands beyond residence as contemporary lifestyles and technological advances redefine the way the global population lives and works.
"Parrots, also known as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 398 species in 92 genera comprising the order Psittaciformes , found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions."
"The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (""true"" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots)."
"One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction, with higher aggregate extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird group."
"Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well."
The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia.
"Characteristic features of parrots include a strong, curved bill, an upright stance, strong legs, and clawed zygodactyl feet."
"Many parrots are vividly coloured, and some are multi-coloured."
Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the visual spectrum.
They form the most variably sized bird order in terms of length.
"The most important components of most parrots' diets are seeds, nuts, fruit, buds, and other plant material."
"A few species sometimes eat animals and carrion, while the lories and lorikeets are specialised for feeding on floral nectar and soft fruits."
"Almost all parrots nest in tree hollows (or nest boxes in captivity), and lay white eggs from which hatch altricial (helpless) young."
"Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets."
"Trapping wild parrots for the pet trade, as well as hunting, habitat loss, and competition from invasive species, has diminished wild populations, with parrots being subjected to more exploitation than any other group of birds."
Measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.
"A body cavity search, also known simply as a cavity search, is either a visual search or a manual internal inspection of body cavities for prohibited materials (contraband), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons."
"Body cavities frequently used for concealment include the mouth, vagina, and rectum."
"It is far more invasive than the standard strip search that is typically performed on individuals taken into custody, either upon police arrest or incarceration at a jail, prison, or psychiatric hospital."
Often the procedure is repeated when the person leaves the institution.
Body cavity searches may also be conducted at some international border crossings such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when they suspect international travelers of hiding contraband—such as drugs
"Primogeniture ( also ) is the right, by law or custom, of the firstborn legitimate child to inherit the parent's entire or main estate in preference to shared inheritance among all or some children, any illegitimate child or any collateral relative."
In most contexts it means the inheritance of the firstborn son (agnatic primogeniture); it can also mean by the firstborn daughter (matrilineal primogeniture).
"Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems."
The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).
"A motel, also known as a motor hotel or motor lodge, is a hotel designed for motorists, usually having each room entered directly from the parking area for motor vehicles rather than through a central lobby."
"Entering dictionaries after World War II, the word motel, coined as a portmanteau of ""motor hotel"", originates from the Milestone Mo-Tel of San Luis Obispo, California (now called the Motel Inn of San Luis Obispo), which was built in 1925."
"The term referred to a type of hotel consisting of a single building of connected rooms whose doors faced a parking lot and in some circumstances, a common area or a series of small cabins with common parking."
"Motels are often individually owned, though motel chains do exist."
"As large highway systems began to be developed in the 1920s, long-distance road journeys became more common, and the need for inexpensive, easily accessible overnight accommodation sites close to the main routes led to the growth of the motel concept."
"Motels peaked in popularity in the 1960s with rising car travel, only to decline in response to competition from the newer chain hotels that became commonplace at highway interchanges as traffic was bypassed onto newly constructed freeways."
Several historic motels are listed on the US National Register of Historic Places.
"A toilet is a piece of sanitary hardware that collects human urine and feces, and sometimes toilet paper, usually for disposal."
"Flush toilets use water, while dry or non-flush toilets do not."
"They can be designed for a sitting position popular in Europe and North America with a toilet seat, with additional considerations for those with disabilities, or for a squatting posture more popular in Asia (see squat toilet)."
"In urban areas, flush toilets are usually connected to a sewer system that leads to septic tanks in isolated areas."
The waste is known as blackwater and the combined effluent including other sources is sewage.
"Dry toilets are connected to a pit, removable container, composting chamber, or other storage and treatment device, including urine diversion with a urine-diverting toilet."
The technology used for modern toilets varies.
"Toilets are commonly made of ceramic (porcelain), concrete, plastic, or wood."
"Newer toilet technologies include dual flushing, low flushing, toilet seat warming, self-cleaning, female urinals and waterless urinals."
Japan is known for its toilet technology.
Airplane toilets are specially designed to operate in the air.
"The need to maintain anal hygiene post-defecation is universally recognized and toilet paper (often held by a toilet roll holder), which may also be used to wipe the vulva after urination, is widely used (as well as bidets)."
"In private homes, depending on the region and style, the toilet may exist in the same bathroom as the sink, bath, and shower."
"Another option is to have one room for body washing (also called ""bathroom"") and a separate one for the toilet and handwashing sink (toilet room)."
Public toilets (restrooms) consist of one or more toilets (and commonly single urinals or trough urinals) which are available for use by the general public.
Products like urinal blocks and toilet blocks help maintain the smell and cleanliness of toilets.
Toilet seat covers are sometimes used.
"Portable toilets (frequently chemical ""porta johns"") may be brought in for large and temporary gatherings."
"Historically, sanitation has been a concern from the earliest stages of human settlements."
"However, many poor households in developing countries use very basic, and often unhygienic, toilets - and nearly one billion people have no access to a toilet at all; they must openly defecate and urinate."
"Or else they must resort to a ""flying toilet"": a plastic bag."
"These issues can lead to the spread of diseases transmitted via the fecal-oral route, or the transmission of waterborne diseases such as cholera and diarrhea."
"Therefore, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 wants to ""achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation""."
A fact is something that is true.
"The usual test for a statement of fact is verifiability, that is whether it can be demonstrated to correspond to experience."
Standard reference works are often used to check facts.
Scientific facts are verified by repeatable careful observation or measurement by experiments or other means.
"For example, ""This sentence contains words."""
"accurately describes a linguistic fact, and ""The sun is a star"" accurately describes an astronomical fact."
"Further, ""Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States"" and ""Abraham Lincoln was assassinated"" both accurately describe historical facts."
"Generally speaking, facts are independent of belief and of knowledge and opinion."
The Chair is an American comedy-drama streaming television series.
"The series was released on Netflix on August 20, 2021."
"It is set at the fictional Pembroke University, ""in what seems like New England""."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, which are located on tracks."
"In contrast to road transport, where the vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which they run."
"Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on sleepers (ties) set in ballast, on which the rolling stock, usually fitted with metal wheels, moves."
"Other variations are also possible, such as ""slab track"", in which the rails are fastened to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface."
"Rolling stock in a rail transport system generally encounters lower frictional resistance than rubber-tired road vehicles, so passenger and freight cars (carriages and wagons) can be coupled into longer trains."
"The operation is carried out by a railway company, providing transport between train stations or freight customer facilities."
"Power is provided by locomotives which either draw electric power from a railway electrification system or produce their own power, usually by diesel engines or, historically, steam engines."
Most tracks are accompanied by a signalling system.
Railways are a safe land transport system when compared to other forms of transport.
"Railway transport is capable of high levels of passenger and cargo utilisation and energy efficiency, but is often less flexible and more capital-intensive than road transport, when lower traffic levels are considered."
"The oldest known, man/animal-hauled railways date back to the 6th century BC in Corinth, Greece."
Rail transport then commenced in mid 16th century in Germany in the form of horse-powered funiculars and wagonways.
Modern rail transport commenced with the British development of the steam locomotive in Merthyr Tydfil when Richard Trevithick ran a steam locomotive and loaded wagons between Penydarren Ironworks and Abercynon in 1802.
Thus the railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world.
"Built by George Stephenson and his son Robert's company Robert Stephenson and Company, the Locomotion No."
"1 is the first steam locomotive to carry passengers on a public rail line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825."
"George Stephenson also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use only the steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830."
"With steam engines, one could construct mainline railways, which were a key component of the Industrial Revolution."
"Also, railways reduced the costs of shipping, and allowed for fewer lost goods, compared with water transport, which faced occasional sinking of ships."
"The change from canals to railways allowed for ""national markets"" in which prices varied very little from city to city."
"The spread of the railway network and the use of railway timetables, led to the standardisation of time (railway time) in Britain based on Greenwich Mean Time."
"Prior to this, major towns and cities varied their local time relative to GMT."
The invention and development of the railway in the United Kingdom was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century.
"The world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway (part of the London Underground), opened in 1863."
"In the 1880s, electrified trains were introduced, leading to electrification of tramways and rapid transit systems."
"Starting during the 1940s, the non-electrified railways in most countries had their steam locomotives replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, with the process being almost complete by the 2000s."
"During the 1960s, electrified high-speed railway systems were introduced in Japan and later in some other countries."
"Many countries are in the process of replacing diesel locomotives with electric locomotives, mainly due to environmental concerns, a notable example being Switzerland, which has completely electrified its network."
"Other forms of guided ground transport outside the traditional railway definitions, such as monorail or maglev, have been tried but have seen limited use."
"Following a decline after World War II due to competition from cars and aeroplanes, rail transport has had a revival in recent decades due to road congestion and rising fuel prices, as well as governments investing in rail as a means of reducing CO2 emissions in the context of concerns about global warming."
Humour (Commonwealth English) or humor (American English) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement.
"The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: humor, ""body fluid""), controlled human health and emotion."
People of all ages and cultures respond to humour.
"Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny (such as a pun or joke)—and thus are considered to have a sense of humour."
"The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour inducing it to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational."
"Though ultimately decided by personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and context."
"For example, young children may favour slapstick such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or the Tom and Jerry cartoons, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them."
"By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience."
"The sea, connected as the world ocean or simply the ocean, is the body of salty water that covers approximately 71 percent of the Earth's surface."
"The word sea is also used to denote second-order sections of the sea, such as the Mediterranean Sea, as well as certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes, such as the Caspian Sea."
"The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle."
"Humans harnessing and studying the sea have been recorded since ancient times, and evidenced well into prehistory, while its modern scientific study is called oceanography."
The most abundant solid dissolved in seawater is sodium chloride.
"The water also contains salts of magnesium, calcium, potassium, and mercury, amongst many other elements, some in minute concentrations."
"Salinity varies widely, being lower near the surface and the mouths of large rivers and higher in the depths of the ocean; however, the relative proportions of dissolved salts vary little across the oceans."
"Winds blowing over the surface of the sea produce waves, which break when they enter the shallow water."
"Winds also create surface currents through friction, setting up slow but stable circulations of water throughout the oceans."
"The directions of the circulation are governed by factors, including the shapes of the continents and Earth's rotation (the Coriolis effect)."
"Deep-sea currents, known as the global conveyor belt, carry cold water from near the poles to every ocean."
"Tides, the generally twice-daily rise and fall of sea levels, are caused by Earth's rotation and the gravitational effects of the orbiting Moon and, to a lesser extent, of the Sun."
Tides may have a very high range in bays or estuaries.
"Submarine earthquakes arising from tectonic plate movements under the oceans can lead to destructive tsunamis, as can volcanoes, huge landslides, or the impact of large meteorites."
"A wide variety of organisms, including bacteria, protists, algae, plants, fungi, and animals, live in the sea, which offers a wide range of marine habitats and ecosystems, ranging vertically from the sunlit surface and shoreline to the great depths and pressures of the cold, dark abyssal zone, and in latitude from the cold waters under polar ice caps to the colourful diversity of coral reefs in tropical regions."
Many of the major groups of organisms evolved in the sea and life may have started there.
"The sea provides substantial supplies of food for humans, mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals and seaweed, whether caught by fishermen or farmed underwater."
"Other human uses of the sea include trade, travel, mineral extraction, power generation, warfare, and leisure activities such as swimming, sailing, and scuba diving."
Many of these activities create marine pollution.
The sea has therefore been for humans an integral element throughout history and culture.
"A computer file is a computer resource for recording data in a computer storage device, primarily identified by its file name."
"Just as words can be written to paper, so can data be written to a computer file."
Files can be edited and transferred through the Internet on that particular computer system.
Different types of computer files are designed for different purposes.
"A file may be designed to store a Image, a written message, a video, a computer program, or any wide variety of other kinds of data."
Certain files can store multiple data types at once.
"By using computer programs, a person can open, read, change, save, and close a computer file."
"Computer files may be reopened, modified, and copied an arbitrary number of times."
"Files are typically organized in a file system, which tracks file locations on the disk and enables user access."
A son is a male offspring; a boy or man in relation to his parents.
The female counterpart is a daughter.
"From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative."
"A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats."
"Small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas."
"However, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment."
"In modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship."
"Anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called ""boats""."
"Boats vary in proportion and construction methods with their intended purpose, available materials, or local traditions."
"Canoes have been used since prehistoric times and remain in use throughout the world for transportation, fishing, and sport."
Fishing boats vary widely in style partly to match local conditions.
"Pleasure craft used in recreational boating include ski boats, pontoon boats, and sailboats."
House boats may be used for vacationing or long-term residence.
Lighters are used to convey cargo to and from large ships unable to get close to shore.
Lifeboats have rescue and safety functions.
Boats can be propelled by manpower (e.g.
"rowboats and paddle boats), wind  (e.g."
"sailboats), and motor (including gasoline, diesel, and electric)."
Dust bunnies (or dustbunnies) are small clumps of dust that form under furniture and in corners that are not cleaned regularly.
"They are made of hair, lint, flakes of dead skin, spider webs, dust and sometimes light rubbish and debris and are held together by static electricity and felt-like entanglement."
They can house dust mites or other parasites and can lower the efficiency of dust filters by clogging them.
"The movement of a single large particle can start the formation of a dust bunny.Dust bunnies are harmful to electronics because they can obstruct air flow through heat sinks, raising temperatures significantly and therefore shortening the life of electronic components.An American trademark for ""Dustbunny"" was registered in 2006 for the ""Dustbunny Cleaner"", a robotic ball with an electrostatic sleeve that rolls around under furniture to collect dust bunnies and other material."
Dust bunnies have been used as an analogy for the accretion of cosmic matter in planetoids.
"The convertible peso (sometimes given as CUC$ and informally called a cuc or a chavito) was one of two official currencies in Cuba, the other being the Cuban peso."
"It had been in limited use since 1994, when its value was pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar."
"On 8 November 2004, the U.S. dollar ceased to be accepted in Cuban retail outlets and left the convertible peso as the only currency in circulation in many Cuban businesses."
"Officially exchangeable only within the country, its value was increased to US$1.08 in April 2005, but reverted to US$1.00 on 15 March 2011."
"The convertible peso was, by the pegged rate, the twelfth-highest-valued currency unit in the world and the highest-valued ""peso"" unit."
"On 22 October 2013, it was announced that the currency was to be scrapped."
"On 10 December 2020, it was announced that monetary unification would take effect from 1 January 2021."
"From that date, the CUC was no longer accepted in many Cuban businesses; it could only be exchanged in banks or CADECAs (casas de cambios), or used in certain shops, for a six-month period."
"On 15 June 2021, it was announced that the CUC would remain exchangeable in banks for a further six months but that no shops would accept them from 1 July."
The final date for exchanging CUCs was 30 December 2021.
"In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions."
"Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil and is of interest in the study of ethics, morality, philosophy, and religion."
"The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context."
A watch is a portable timepiece intended to be carried or worn by a person.
It is designed to keep a consistent movement despite the motions caused by the person's activities.
"A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet, including metal bands, leather straps or any other kind of bracelet."
"A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket, often attached to a chain."
"Watches were developed in the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th century."
"During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel."
These are called mechanical watches.
"In the 1960s the electronic quartz watch was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal."
By the 1980s the quartz watch had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.
"Historically, this is called the quartz revolution (also known as quartz crisis in Switzerland)."
"Developments in the 2010s include smartwatches, which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed to be worn on a wrist."
"They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities."
"In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month, and year."
"For mechanical watches, various extra features called ""complications,"" such as moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes included."
"Most electronic quartz watches, on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs and alarm functions."
"Furthermore, some modern watches (like smartwatches) even incorporate calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly correct the time."
Most watches that are used mainly for timekeeping have quartz movements.
"However, expensive collectible watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal, and glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic ones."
"As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction was the Patek Philippe Henry Graves Supercomplication, the world's most complicated mechanical watch until 1989, fetching US$24 million (CHF 23,237,000) in Geneva on 11 November 2014."
"As of December 2019, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction (and wristwatch) was the Patek Philippe Grandmaster Chime Ref."
"6300A-010, fetching US$31.19 million (CHF 31,000,000) in Geneva on 9 November 2019."
"Antidepressants are medications used to treat major depressive disorder, some anxiety disorders, some chronic pain conditions, and to help manage some addictions."
"Common side-effects of antidepressants include dry mouth, weight gain, dizziness, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and emotional blunting."
"There is a slight increased risk of suicidal thinking and behavior when taken by children, adolescents, and young adults."
A discontinuation syndrome can occur after stopping any antidepressant which resembles recurrent depression.Some reviews of antidepressants for depression in adults find benefit while others do not.
Evidence of benefit in children and adolescents is unclear.
The twenty-one most commonly prescribed antidepressant medications were found to be more effective than placebo for adults with major depressive disorder in a 2016 meta-study.
"There is debate in the medical community about how much of the observed effects of antidepressants can be attributed to the placebo effect, with some claiming that there is no effect above and beyond it."
"Most research on whether antidepressant drugs work is done on people with very severe symptoms, a population who exhibits much weaker placebo responses, so the results cannot be extrapolated to the general population.There are effective treatments for depression which do not involve medications or may be used in conjunction with medications."
"Modern Times is a 1936 American silent comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world."
"The film is a commentary on the desperate employment and financial conditions many people faced during the Great Depression — conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization."
"The movie stars Chaplin, Paulette Goddard, Henry Bergman, Tiny Sandford and Chester Conklin."
It is notable for being the last time that Chaplin portrayed the Tramp character and for being the first time Chaplin's voice is heard on film.
"In 1989, Modern Times was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""."
"In 2003, it was screened ""out of competition"" at the Cannes Film Festival."
Earl () is a rank of the nobility in the United Kingdom.
"The title originates in the Old English word eorl, meaning ""a man of noble birth or rank""."
"The word is cognate with the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant ""chieftain"", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead."
"In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (hertig/hertug/hertog)."
"After the Norman Conquest, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland, it assimilated the concept of mormaer)."
"However, earlier in Scandinavia, jarl could also mean a sovereign prince."
"For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of jarl and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king."
"Alternative names for the rank equivalent to ""earl"" or ""count"" in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as the hakushaku (伯爵) of the post-restoration Japanese Imperial era."
"In modern Britain, an earl is a member of the peerage, ranking below a marquess and above a viscount."
"A feminine form of earl never developed; instead, countess is used."
"The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state, with the aim to enforce the law, to ensure the safety, health and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder."
Their lawful powers include arrest and the use of force legitimized by the state via the monopoly on violence.
The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility.
"Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing."
"Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes."
Law enforcement is only part of policing activity.
"Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order."
"In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property."
Police forces have become ubiquitous in modern societies.
"Nevertheless, their role can be controversial, as they may be involved to varying degrees in corruption, brutality and the enforcement of authoritarian rule."
"A police force may also be referred to as a police department, police service, constabulary, gendarmerie, crime prevention, protective services, law enforcement agency, civil guard, or civic guard."
"Members may be referred to as police officers, troopers, sheriffs, constables, rangers, peace officers or civic/civil guards."
"Ireland differs from other English-speaking countries by using the Irish language terms Garda (singular) and Gardaí (plural), for both the national police force and its members."
The word police is the most universal and similar terms can be seen in many non-English speaking countries.Numerous slang terms exist for the police.
Many slang terms for police officers are decades or centuries old with lost etymologies.
"One of the oldest, cop, has largely lost its slang connotations and become a common colloquial term used both by the public and police officers to refer to their profession."
Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria.
"They first appeared during the Triassic period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research."
They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 million years ago; their dominance continued throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
"The fossil record shows that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are the only dinosaur lineage to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 million years ago."
"Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs, or birds; and the extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all dinosaurs other than birds."
"Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals from taxonomic, morphological and ecological standpoints."
"Birds, at over 10,700 living species, are among the most diverse group of vertebrates."
"Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 900 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs."
Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains.
"Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized as dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded."
"Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction."
"Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous."
"Evidence suggests that all dinosaurs were egg-laying; and that nest-building was a trait shared by many dinosaurs, both avian and non-avian."
"While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal species, and some were able to shift between these stances."
"Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines."
"While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were the largest land animals of all time."
"The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized."
"Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length."
"The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name ""dinosaur"" (meaning ""terrible lizard"") having been coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1841 to refer to these ""great fossil lizards""."
"Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture."
"The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park."
"Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media."
Annona reticulata is a small deciduous or semi-evergreen tree in the plant family Annonaceae and part of the Annonas group.
"It is best known for its fruit, called custard apple, a common name shared with fruits of several other species in the same genus: A. cherimola and A. squamosa."
"Its common names include wild sweetsop, soursop and bullock's heart."
"The fruit is sweet and useful in preparation of desserts, but is generally less popular for eating than that of A. cherimola."
A uniform is a variety of clothing worn by members of an organization while participating in that organization's activity.
"Modern uniforms are most often worn by armed forces and paramilitary organizations such as police, emergency services, security guards, in some workplaces and schools and by inmates in prisons."
"In some countries, some other officials also wear uniforms in their duties; such is the case of the Commissioned Corps of the United States Public Health Service or the French prefects."
"For some organizations, such as police, it may be illegal for non members to wear the uniform."
"Tomato paste is a thick paste made by cooking tomatoes for several hours to reduce the water content, straining out the seeds and skins, and cooking the liquid again to reduce the base to a thick, rich concentrate."
"It is used to impart an intense tomato flavour to a variety of dishes, such as pasta, soups and braised meat."
"By contrast, tomato purée is a liquid with a thinner consistency than tomato paste, while tomato sauce is even thinner in consistency."
"A tax is a compulsory financial charge or some other type of levy imposed on a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity) by a governmental organization in order to fund government spending and various public expenditures (regional, local, or national), and tax compliance refers to policy actions and individual behaviour aimed at ensuring that taxpayers are paying the right amount of tax at the right time and securing the correct tax allowances and tax reliefs.The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC."
"A failure to pay in a timely manner (non-compliance), along with evasion of or resistance to taxation, is punishable by law."
Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.
"Most countries have a tax system in place, in order to pay for public, common, or agreed national needs and for the functions of government."
"Some levy a flat percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale taxes are progressive based on brackets of annual income amounts."
Most countries charge a tax on an individual's income as well as on corporate income.
"Countries or subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, use taxes, payroll taxes, duties and/or tariffs."
"In economic terms, taxation transfers wealth from households or businesses to the government."
This has effects that can both increase and reduce economic growth and economic welfare.
"Consequently, taxation is a highly debated topic."
"A line of credit is a credit facility extended by a bank or other financial institution to a government, business or individual customer that enables the customer to draw on the facility when the customer needs funds."
"A line of credit takes several forms, such as an overdraft limit, demand loan, special purpose, export packing credit, term loan, discounting, purchase of commercial bills, traditional revolving credit card account, etc."
It is effectively a source of funds that can readily be tapped at the borrower's discretion.
Interest is paid only on money actually withdrawn.
"Lines of credit can be secured by collateral, or may be unsecured."
"Lines of credit are often extended by banks, financial institutions and other licensed consumer lenders to creditworthy customers (though certain special-purpose lines of credit may not have creditworthiness requirements) to address fluctuating cash flow needs of the customer."
The maximum amount of funds a customer is allowed to draw from a line of credit is typically called the credit limit or overdraft limit.
The term credit limit is commonly used for credit cards whereas the term overdraft limit is more commonly used for bank accounts.
"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79, making it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally."
"In a pure form, it is a bright, slightly orange yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal."
"Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element."
It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.
"Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits."
"It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and also as mineral inclusions such as within pyrite."
"Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides)."
"Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), which forms a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion."
"Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term acid test."
"Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating."
"Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction."
"A relatively rare element, gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history."
"In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1971."
"A total of around 201,296 tonnes of gold exists above ground, as of 2020."
This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly 21.7 meters (71 ft).
"The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50% in jewelry, 40% in investments, and 10% in industry."
"Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use)."
"Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration."
Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.
"As of 2017, the world's largest gold producer by far was China with 440 tonnes per year."
The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of a small carnivorous mammal.
It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
"A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact."
Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
"About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey."
Its night vision and sense of smell are well developed.
"Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language."
"A predator that is most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular), the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species."
"It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals."
"Cats also secrete and perceive pheromones.Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens."
"Domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy."
"Population control of cats may be effected by spaying and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species.Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around 7500 BC."
"It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where cats were venerated from around 3100 BC."
"As of 2021, there are an estimated 220 million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world."
"As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States, with 95 million cats owned."
"In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat with an estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020."

Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera.
"With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight."
"Bats are more maneuverable than most birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium."
"The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1+1⁄8–1+3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass."
"The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3+1⁄2 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in)."
"The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species."
"These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats."
"But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats."
"Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters)."
"A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood."
"Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators."
"Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions."
They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.
"Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages."
Bat dung has been mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser.
"Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides and other insect management measures."
"They are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim."
"However, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by fruit growers."
"Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves."
"If humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans."
"Depending on the culture, bats may be symbolically associated with positive traits, such as protection from certain diseases or risks, rebirth, or long life, but in the West, bats are popularly associated with darkness, malevolence, witchcraft, vampires, and death."
"Death is the permanent, irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism."
Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death.
The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death.
"Death is an inevitable, universal process that eventually occurs in all organisms."
"Death is generally applied to whole organisms; the similar process seen in individual components of an organism, such as cells or tissues, is necrosis."
"Something that is not considered an organism, such as a virus, can be physically destroyed but is not said to die."
"As of the early 21st century, over 150,000 humans die each day, with aging being by far the most common cause of death."
"Death, particularly of humans, has commonly been considered a sad or unpleasant occasion, due to the affection for the deceased and the termination of social and familial bonds."
"Other concerns include fear of death or anxiety from the thought of death, necrophobia, feelings of sorrow, grief, depression, solitude or saudade for the deceased and/or feelings of sympathy or compassion for the deceased or the loved ones of the deceased."
"Many cultures and religions have the idea of an afterlife, and also may hold the idea of judgement of good and bad deeds in one's life (Heaven, Hell, Karma)."
An aunt is a woman who is a sibling of a parent or married to a sibling of a parent.
Aunts who are related by birth are second-degree relatives.
Known alternate terms include auntie or aunty.
Children in other cultures and families may refer to the cousins of their parents as aunt or uncle due to the age and generation gap.
"The male counterpart of an aunt is an uncle, and the reciprocal relationship is that of a nephew or niece."
"A dental drill or handpiece is a hand-held, mechanical instrument used to perform a variety of common dental procedures, including removing decay, polishing fillings, performing cosmetic dentistry, and altering prostheses."
"The handpiece itself consists of internal mechanical components which initiate a rotational force and provide power to the cutting instrument, usually a dental burr."
The type of apparatus used clinically will vary depending on the required function dictated by the dental procedure.
"It is common for a light source and cooling water-spray system to also be incorporated into certain handpieces; this improves visibility, accuracy and overall success of the procedure."
The burrs are usually made of tungsten carbide or diamond.
"Yogurt (UK: ; US: , from Turkish: yoğurt)  also spelled yoghurt, yogourt or yoghourt, is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk."
The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as yogurt cultures.
"Fermentation of sugars in the milk by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor."
Cow's milk is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt.
"Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks are also used to produce yogurt."
The milk used may be homogenized or not.
It may be pasteurized or raw.
Each type of milk produces substantially different results.
Yogurt is produced using a culture of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.
bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus bacteria.
"In addition, other lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are sometimes added during or after culturing yogurt."
"Some countries require yogurt to contain a specific amount of colony-forming units (CFU) of bacteria; in China, for example, the requirement for the number of lactobacillus bacteria is at least 1 million CFU per milliliter.To produce yogurt, milk is first heated, usually to about 85 °C (185 °F), to denature the milk proteins so that they do not form curds."
"After heating, the milk is allowed to cool to about 45 °C (113 °F)."
"The bacterial culture is mixed in, and a warm temperature of 30-45 °C (86-113 °F) is maintained for 4 to 12 hours to allow fermentation to occur, with the higher temperatures working faster but risking a lumpy texture or whey separation."
"A number is a mathematical object used to count, measure, and label."
"The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth."
Numbers can be represented in language with number words.
"More universally, individual numbers can be represented by symbols, called numerals; for example, ""5"" is a numeral that represents the number five."
"As only a relatively small number of symbols can be memorized, basic numerals are commonly organized in a numeral system, which is an organized way to represent any number."
"The most common numeral system is the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, which allows for the representation of any number using a combination of ten fundamental numeric symbols, called digits."
"In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers), and for codes (as with ISBNs)."
"In common usage, a numeral is not clearly distinguished from the number that it represents."
"In mathematics, the notion of a number has been extended over the centuries to include 0, negative numbers, rational numbers such as one half 
  
    
      
        
          (

          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left({\sqrt {2}}\right)}
   and π, and complex numbers which extend the real numbers with a square root of −1 (and its combinations with real numbers by adding or subtracting its multiples)."
"Calculations with numbers are done with arithmetical operations, the most familiar being addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation."
"Their study or usage is called arithmetic, a term which may also refer to number theory, the study of the properties of numbers."
"Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world."
"For example, in Western society, the number 13 is often regarded as unlucky, and ""a million"" may signify ""a lot"" rather than an exact quantity."
"Though it is now regarded as pseudoscience, belief in a mystical significance of numbers, known as numerology, permeated ancient and medieval thought."
"Numerology heavily influenced the development of Greek mathematics, stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers, and may be seen as extending the concept."
"Among the first were the hypercomplex numbers, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system."
"In modern mathematics, number systems are considered important special examples of more general algebraic structures such as rings and fields, and the application of the term ""number"" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"Christian Science is a set of beliefs and practices associated with members of The First Church of Christ, Scientist."
"Adherents are commonly known as Christian Scientists or students of Christian Science, and the church is sometimes informally known as the Christian Science church."
"It was founded in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who wrote the 1875 book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, which outlined the theology of Christian Science."
"The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.Eddy and 26 followers were granted a charter by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1879 to found the ""Church of Christ (Scientist)""; the church would be reorganized under the name ""Church of Christ, Scientist"" in 1892."
"The Mother Church, The First Church of Christ, Scientist, was built in Boston, Massachusetts in 1894."
"Christian Science became the fastest growing religion in the United States, with nearly 270,000 members there by 1936, a figure that had declined by 1990 to just over 100,000, and by 2009 reportedly to under 50,000."
"The church is known for its newspaper, The Christian Science Monitor, which won seven Pulitzer Prizes between 1950 and 2002, and for its public Reading Rooms around the world.Eddy described Christian Science as a return to ""primitive Christianity and its lost element of healing""."
There are key differences between Christian Science theology and that of traditional Christianity.
"In particular, adherents subscribe to a radical form of philosophical idealism, believing that reality is purely spiritual and the material world an illusion."
"This includes the view that disease is a mental error rather than physical disorder, and that the sick should be treated not by medicine but by a form of prayer that seeks to correct the beliefs responsible for the illusion of ill health.The church does not require that Christian Scientists avoid medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, physicians for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine."
"Most controversially, the reliance on prayer and avoidance of medical treatment has been blamed for the deaths of several adherents and their children."
"Between the 1880s and 1990s, parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect."
"A used car, a pre-owned vehicle, or a secondhand car, is a vehicle that has previously had one or more retail owners."
"Used cars are sold through a variety of outlets, including franchise and independent car dealers, rental car companies, buy here pay here dealerships, leasing offices, auctions, and private party sales."
"Some car retailers offer ""no-haggle prices,"" ""certified"" used cars, and extended service plans or warranties."
"Norah Head Lightstation Precinct is a heritage-listed former lighthouse precinct located at Bush Street, Norah Head in the Central Coast local government area of New South Wales, Australia."
The Norah Head lighthouse and associated buildings were designed by Cecil W. Darley and built in 1903.
The precinct was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 April 2007.
"Iran (Persian: ایران Irān [ʔiːˈɾɒːn] (listen)), also called Persia, and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran, is a country in Western Asia."
"It is bordered to the west by Iraq and Turkey, to the northwest by Azerbaijan and Armenia, to the north by the Caspian Sea and Turkmenistan, to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to the south by the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf."
"Iran covers an area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), making it the fourth-largest country entirely in Asia and the second-largest in Western Asia."
"Its population is 85 million, the 17th-most populous in the world."
The capital and largest city is Tehran.
"Iran is home to one of the world's oldest civilizations, beginning with the formation of the Elamite kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC."
"It was first unified by the Iranian Medes in the seventh century BC, and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when Cyrus the Great founded the Achaemenid Empire, which became one of the largest empires in history and has been described as the world's first superpower."
The empire fell to Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and was divided into several Hellenistic states.
"An Iranian rebellion established the Parthian Empire in the third century BC, which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sasanian Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries."
"Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD, which led to the Islamization of Iran."
"It subsequently became a major center of Islamic culture and learning, with its art, literature, philosophy, and architecture spreading across the Muslim world and beyond during the Islamic Golden Age."
"Over the next two centuries, a series of native Muslim dynasties emerged before the Seljuq Turks and the Mongols conquered the region."
"In the 15th century, the native Safavids re-established a unified Iranian state and national identity and converted the country to Shia Islam."
"Under the reign of Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran once again became a major world power, though by the 19th century a series of conflicts with Russia led to significant territorial losses."
The early 20th century saw the Persian Constitutional Revolution.
"Efforts to nationalize its fossil fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political influence."
He went on to launch a far-reaching series of reforms in 1963.
"After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic Republic was established in 1979 by Ruhollah Khomeini, who became the country's first Supreme Leader."
"The Government of Iran is an Islamic theocracy which includes elements of a presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority vested in an autocratic ""Supreme Leader"", a position held by Ali Khamenei since Khomeini's death in 1989."
"The Iranian government is widely considered to be authoritarian, and has attracted widespread criticism for its significant constraints and abuses against human rights and civil liberties, including several violent suppressions of mass protests, unfair elections, and limited rights for women and children."
"It is also a focal point for Shia Islam within the Middle East, countering the long-existing Arab Sunni hegemony within the region, and is often considered Israel's largest adversary."
"The state is considered one of the biggest players within Middle Eastern affairs, with its government directly or indirectly involved in a majority of modern Middle Eastern conflicts."
"Iran is a regional and middle power, with a geopolitically strategic location in the Asian continent."
"It is a founding member of the United Nations, the ECO, the OIC, and the OPEC."
It has large reserves of fossil fuels—including the world's second-largest natural gas supply and the fourth-largest proven oil reserves.
The country's rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 26 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
"Historically a multinational state, Iran remains a pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, the largest being Persians, Azeris, Kurds, Mazandaranis and Lurs."
"Leafy spurge may refer to several species of plant in the genus Euphorbia, including:

Euphorbia esula
Euphorbia virgata"
"A year is the orbital period of a planetary body, for example, the Earth, moving in its orbit around the Sun."
"Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility."
"In temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn and winter."
"In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked."
"A calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period, as counted in a given calendar."
"The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars (see below)."
"For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days."
"In English, the abbreviations ""y"" and ""yr"" are commonly used (""a"" is also used) for the unit of time, though its exact duration may be inconsistent."
"In astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.The word year is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc."
"Similarly, year can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit."
"The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year."
"Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four temperate seasons."
"Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere)."
Autumn is the season when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably.
Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere).
One of its main features in temperate climates is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
"Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as ""mid-autumn"", while others with a longer temperature lag treat the equinox as the start of autumn."
"In the English-speaking world, autumn traditionally began with Lammas Day and ended around Hallowe'en, the approximate mid-points between midsummer, the autumnal equinox, and midwinter."
"Meteorologists (and Australia and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere."
"In North America, autumn traditionally starts with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and ends with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December)."
"Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date."
"As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees change colour and then shed their leaves.In traditional East Asian solar term, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November."
"In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met Éireann, are September, October and November."
"However, according to the Irish Calendar, which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition."
"In the Irish language, September is known as Meán Fómhair (""middle of autumn"") and October as Deireadh Fómhair (""end of autumn"")."
Persians celebrate the beginning of the autumn as Mehregan to honor Mithra (Mehr).
A house is a single-unit residential building.
"It may range in complexity from a rudimentary hut to a complex structure of wood, masonry, concrete or other material, outfitted with plumbing, electrical, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems."
Houses use a range of different roofing systems to keep precipitation such as rain from getting into the dwelling space.
Houses may have doors or locks to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from burglars or other trespassers.
"Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen or cooking area, and a living room."
"A house may have a separate dining room, or the eating area may be integrated into another room."
Some large houses in North America have a recreation room.
"In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans."
The social unit that lives in a house is known as a household.
"Most commonly, a household is a family unit of some kind, although households may also be other social groups, such as roommates or, in a rooming house, unconnected individuals."
Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called townhouses or row houses may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure.
"A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a garage for vehicles or a shed for gardening equipment and tools."
"A house may have a backyard or a front yard or both, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat."
"In geology, a rock (or stone) is any naturally occurring solid mass or aggregate of minerals or mineraloid matter."
"It is categorized by the minerals included, its chemical composition and the way in which it is formed."
"Rocks form the Earth's outer solid layer, the crust, and most of its interior, except for the liquid outer core and pockets of magma in the asthenosphere."
"Rocks are usually grouped into three main groups: igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks."
"Igneous rocks are formed when magma cools in the Earth's crust, or lava cools on the ground surface or the seabed."
"Sedimentary rocks are formed by diagenesis or lithification of sediments, which in turn are formed by the weathering, transport, and deposition of existing rocks."
"Metamorphic rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to such high pressures and temperatures that they are transformed—something that occurs, for example, when continental plates collide."
": 31–33, 134–139 The scientific study of the character and origin of rocks is called petrology, which is an essential subdiscipline of geology."
Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse or other forms of sexual penetration carried out against a person without that person's consent.
"The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority, or against a person who is incapable of giving valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, has an intellectual disability, or is below the legal age of consent."
"The term rape is sometimes used interchangeably with the term sexual assault.The rate of reporting, prosecuting and convicting for rape varies between jurisdictions."
"Internationally, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police during 2008 ranged, per 100,000 people, from 0.2 in Azerbaijan to 92.9 in Botswana with 6.3 in Lithuania as the median."
"Worldwide, sexual violence, including rape, is primarily committed by males against females."
"Rape by strangers is usually less common than rape by people the victim knows, and male-on-male and female-on-female prison rapes are common and may be the least reported forms of rape.Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., war rape) and sexual slavery can occur during international conflict."
These practices are crimes against humanity and war crimes.
"Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group."
People who have been raped can be traumatized and develop post-traumatic stress disorder.
Serious injuries can result along with the risk of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
"A person may face violence or threats from the rapist, and, sometimes, from the victim's family and relatives."
The mind is the set of faculties responsible for mental phenomena.
Often the term is also identified with the phenomena themselves.
"These faculties include thought, imagination, memory, will and sensation."
"They are responsible for various mental phenomena, like perception, pain experience, belief, desire, intention and emotion."
Various overlapping classifications of mental phenomena have been proposed.
"Important distinctions group them together according to whether they are sensory, propositional, intentional, conscious or occurrent."
Minds were traditionally understood as substances but it is more common in the contemporary perspective to conceive them as properties or capacities possessed by humans and higher animals.
Various competing definitions of the exact nature of the mind or mentality have been proposed.
Epistemic definitions focus on the privileged epistemic access the subject has to these states.
Consciousness-based approaches give primacy to the conscious mind and allow unconscious mental phenomena as part of the mind only to the extent that they stand in the right relation to the conscious mind.
"According to intentionality-based approaches, the power to refer to objects and to represent the world is the mark of the mental."
"For behaviorism, whether an entity has a mind only depends on how it behaves in response to external stimuli while functionalism defines mental states in terms of the causal roles they play."
"Central questions for the study of mind, like whether other entities besides humans have minds or how the relation between body and mind is to be conceived, are strongly influenced by the choice of one's definition."
"Mind or mentality is usually contrasted with body, matter or physicality."
The issue of the nature of this contrast and specifically the relation between mind and brain is called the mind-body problem.
"Traditional viewpoints included dualism and idealism, which consider the mind to be non-physical."
"Modern views often center around physicalism and functionalism, which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or reducible to physical phenomena such as neuronal activity though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters."
Another question concerns which types of beings are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).
"For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all animals, by all living things, whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of human-made machines."
"Different cultural and religious traditions often use different concepts of mind, resulting in different answers to these questions."
Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g.
"panpsychism and animism), to animals and to deities."
"Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with soul or spirit) to theories concerning both life after death, and cosmological and natural order, for example in the doctrines of Zoroaster, the Buddha, Plato, Aristotle, and other ancient Greek, Indian and, later, Islamic and medieval European philosophers."
"Psychologists such as Freud and James, and computer scientists such as Turing developed influential theories about the nature of the mind."
"The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of artificial intelligence, which works closely in relation with cybernetics and information theory to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind."
The mind is also sometimes portrayed as the stream of consciousness where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.
A street is a public thoroughfare in a built environment.
"It is a public parcel of land adjoining buildings in an urban context, on which people may freely assemble, interact, and move about."
"A street can be as simple as a level patch of dirt, but is more often paved with a hard, durable surface such as tarmac, concrete, cobblestone or brick."
"Portions may also be smoothed with asphalt, embedded with rails, or otherwise prepared to accommodate non-pedestrian traffic."
"Originally, the word street simply meant a paved road (Latin: via strata)."
"The word street is still sometimes used informally as a synonym for road, for example in connection with the ancient Watling Street, but city residents and urban planners draw a crucial modern distinction: a road's main function is transportation, while streets facilitate public interaction."
"Examples of streets include pedestrian streets, alleys, and city-centre streets too crowded for road vehicles to pass."
"Conversely, highways and motorways are types of roads, but few would refer to them as streets."
"In human society, family (from Latin: familia) is a group of people related either by consanguinity (by recognized birth) or affinity (by marriage or other relationship)."
The purpose of families is to maintain the well-being of its members and of society.
"Ideally, families would offer predictability, structure, and safety as members mature and participate in the community."
"In most societies, it is within families that children acquire socialization for life outside the family, and acts as the primary source of attachment, nurturing, and socialization for humans."
"Additionally, as the basic unit for meeting the basic needs of its members, it provides a sense of boundaries for performing tasks in a safe environment, ideally builds a person into a functional adult, transmits culture, and ensures continuity of humankind with precedents of knowledge."
"Anthropologists generally classify most family organizations as matrifocal (a mother and her children); patrifocal (a father and his children); conjugal (a wife, her husband, and children, also called the nuclear family); avuncular (for example, a grandparent, a brother, his sister, and her children); or extended (parents and children co-reside with other members of one parent's family)."
"Members of the immediate family may include spouses, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters."
"Members of the extended family may include aunts, uncles, cousins, nephews, nieces, and siblings-in-law."
"Sometimes these are also considered members of the immediate family, depending on an individual's specific relationship with them, and the legal definition of ""immediate family"" varies."
Sexual relations with family members are regulated by rules concerning incest such as the incest taboo.
The field of genealogy aims to trace family lineages through history.
The family is also an important economic unit studied in family economics.
"The word ""families"" can be used metaphorically to create more inclusive categories such as community, nationhood, and global village."
"The ukulele ( YOO-kə-LAY-lee; from Hawaiian: ʻukulele [ˈʔukuˈlɛlɛ], approximately OO-koo-LEH-leh)  is a member of the lute family of instruments of Portuguese origin and popularized in Hawaii."
It generally employs four nylon strings.The tone and volume of the instrument vary with size and construction.
"Ukuleles commonly come in four sizes: soprano, concert, tenor, and baritone."
"Do-it-yourself biology (DIY biology, DIY bio) is a growing biotechnological social movement in which individuals, communities, and small organizations study biology and life science using the same methods as traditional research institutions."
"DIY biology is primarily undertaken by individuals with limited research training from academia or corporations, who then mentor and oversee other DIY biologists with little or no formal training."
"This may be done as a hobby, as a not-for-profit endeavour for community learning and open-science innovation, or for profit, to start a business."
Other terms are also associated with the do-it-yourself biology community.
The terms biohacking and wetware hacking emphasize the connection to hacker culture and the hacker ethic.
The term hacker is used in the original sense of finding new and clever ways to do things.
"The term biohacking is also used by the grinder body modification community, which is considered related but distinct from the do-it-yourself biology movement."
"The term biopunk emphasizes the techno-progressive, political, and artistic elements of the movement."
"A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes."
It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis.
"A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
"A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases."
"A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual."
"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources."
"Library buildings often provide quiet and conducive areas for studying, as well as common areas for group study and collaboration, and may provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources; for instance: computers and access to the Internet."
"The library's clientele and therefore the services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library, for example."
"Libraries may also be community hubs, where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning."
"Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of a building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet."
Hence managing information in an information world has become very easy simply because information can be provided or being accessed virtually by people who are in remote areas and other places away from the library.
"The services the library offers are variously described as library services, information services, or the combination ""library and information services"", although different institutions and sources define such terminology differently."
News is information about current events.
"This may be provided through many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems, broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of observers and witnesses to events."
"News is sometimes called ""hard news"" to differentiate it from soft media."
"Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events."
"Government proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times."
"Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content."
The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the newspaper.
"Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech-based writing systems."
The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).
"A building, or edifice, is a structure with a roof and walls standing more or less permanently in one place, such as a house or factory."
"Buildings come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and functions, and have been adapted throughout history for a wide number of factors, from building materials available, to weather conditions, land prices, ground conditions, specific uses, and aesthetic reasons."
To better understand the term building compare the list of nonbuilding structures.
"Buildings serve several societal needs – primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work."
A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the human habitat (a place of comfort and safety) and the outside (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).
"Ever since the first cave paintings, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression."
"In recent years, interest in sustainable planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings and other structures."
"Rhododendron menziesii, also classified as Menziesia ferruginea, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, known by several common names, including rusty menziesia, false huckleberry, fool's huckleberry and mock azalea."
"Sweatpants are a casual variety of soft trousers intended for comfort or athletic purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations."
"In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa they are known as tracksuit bottoms."
"In Australia and New Zealand, they are also commonly known as trackpants, trackies or tracky daks."
"A vine (Latin vīnea ""grapevine"", ""vineyard"", from vīnum ""wine"") is any plant with a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or runners."
"The word vine can also refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance, when used in wicker work.In parts of the world, including the British Isles, the term ""vine"" usually applies exclusively to grapevines (Vitis), while the term ""climber"" is used for all climbing plants."
A cloak of invisibility is a fictional theme.
"In folklore, mythology and fairy tales, a cloak of invisibility appears either as a magical item used by duplicitous characters or an item worn by a hero to fulfill a quest."
"It is a common theme in Welsh and Germanic folklore, and may originate with the cap of invisibility seen in ancient Greek myths."
"The motif falls under ""D1361.12 magic cloak of invisibility"" in the Stith Thompson motif index scheme."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Suggestion is the psychological process by which a person guides their own or another person's desired thoughts, feelings, and behaviors by presenting stimuli that may elicit them as reflexes instead of relying on conscious effort."
"Nineteenth-century writers on psychology such as William James used the words ""suggest"" and ""suggestion"" in the context of a particular idea which was said to suggest another when it brought that other idea to mind."
"Early scientific studies of hypnosis by Clark Leonard Hull and others extended the meaning of these words in a special and technical sense (Hull, 1933)."
"The original neuropsychological theory of hypnotic suggestion was based upon the ideomotor reflex response that William B. Carpenter declared, in 1852, was the principle through which James Braid's hypnotic phenomena were produced."
"Cooking, cookery, or culinary arts is the art, science, and craft of using heat to prepare food for consumption."
"Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting local conditions."
Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of the cooks.
Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans.
"It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for the same does not predate more than 1 million years.The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients."
"New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling of water, expanded cooking techniques."
Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.
Unearned increment is an increase in the value of land or any property without expenditure of any kind on the part of the proprietor; it is an early statement of the notion of unearned income.
"It was coined by John Stuart Mill, who proposed taxing it so that it benefits every member of a society."
Mill's concept was refined and developed by nineteenth-century economist Henry George in his book Progress and Poverty (1879).
George argued that the value of land increased as population growth expanded the division of labor.
A landowner’s exclusive claim to their land granted them the ability to collect the excess productivity as economic rent.
"Thorstein Veblen further developed the concept, pointing out that the value of a piece of land was also dependent on current technological capabilities."
"Veblen thought the unearned increment increased as the industrial arts advanced, so the argument could be extended from land to capital goods."
"Focusing on the role of technical knowledge in the creation and operation of capital, Veblen argues the unearned increment in the case of capital is in the monopolization of the community’s knowledge."
"As industrial methods advance and the unit of industrial equipment grows larger, it becomes feasible to monopolize the required materials for earning a living, effectively monopolizing a portion of the community’s knowledge."
"For both George and Veblen, the unearned increment emerges from the actions of an individual with the ability to exclusively use a community asset in order to generate profit."
The profit takes the form of an unearned increment because the individual reaping the profit didn’t create the land (or knowledge) used to do so.
Both thinkers also argued that such monopolization of the community’s resources would lead to the creation of economic slavery.
"The Crown is the state in all its aspects within the jurisprudence of the Commonwealth realms and their subdivisions (such as the Crown Dependencies, overseas territories, provinces, or states)."
"Legally ill-defined, the term has different meanings depending on context."
"It is used to designate the monarch in either a personal capacity, as Head of the Commonwealth, or as the king or queen of his or her realms."
"It can also refer to the rule of law; however, in common parlance 'The Crown' refers to the functions of government and the civil service.A corporation sole, the Crown is the legal embodiment of executive, legislative, and judicial governance in the monarchy of each commonwealth realm."
"These monarchies are united by the personal union of their monarch, but they are independent states."
The concept of the Crown developed first in England as a separation of the literal crown and property of the kingdom from the person and personal property of the monarch.
"It spread through English and later British colonisation and is now rooted in the legal lexicon of the United Kingdom, its Crown dependencies, and the other 14 independent realms."
"It is not to be confused with any physical crown, such as those of the British regalia.The term is also found in various expressions such as ""Crown land"", which some countries refer to as ""public land"" or ""state land""; as well as in some offices, such as minister of the Crown, Crown attorney, and Crown prosecutor."
A stove is a device that burns fuel or uses electricity to generate heat inside or on top of the apparatus.
It has seen many developments over time and serves the main purpose of cooking food.
"There are many types of stoves, such as the kitchen stove, the wood-burning stove or the coal stove."
"Each type of stove varies in efficiency of heat, as such, many different materials and designs have been developed for varying levels of efficiency and purpose."
"Due to concerns about air pollution, efforts have been made to improve the stove design over the years."
"Pellet stoves, for example, are a type of clean-burning stove."
"Whereas, air-tight stoves are another type that burn the wood more completely and therefore, reduce the amount of the combustion by-products."
"Another method of reducing air pollution is through the addition of a device to clean the exhaust gas, for example, a filter or afterburner.All wood stoves manufactured In the United States since 1992 are required to limit emission of particulates.Research and development on safer and less emission releasing stoves is continuously evolving."
The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail.
"The dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative."
"The dog was the first species to be domesticated, by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids."
"Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes."
"Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color."
"They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people."
"This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of ""man's best friend."""
"A party is a gathering of people who have been invited by a host for the purposes of socializing, conversation, recreation, or as part of a festival or other commemoration or celebration of a special occasion."
"A party will typically feature food and beverages, and often music and dancing or other forms of entertainment."
"In many Western countries, parties for teens and adults are associated with drinking alcohol such as beer, wine, or distilled spirits."
"More occasionally (though often in politics), a party can also simply refer to a group of people with a common objective."
Distance is a numerical measurement of how far apart objects or points are.
"In Physics or everyday usage, distance may refer to a physical length or an estimation based on other criteria (e.g."
"""two counties over"")."
"The distance from a point A to a point B is sometimes denoted as 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        A
        B
        
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle |AB|}
  ."
"In most cases, ""distance from A to B"" is interchangeable with ""distance from B to A""."
"In mathematics, a distance function or metric is a generalization of the concept of physical distance; it is a way of describing what it means for elements of some space to be ""close to"", or ""far away from"" each other."
"In psychology and social sciences, distance is a non-numerical measurement; Psychological distance is defined as ""the different ways in which an object might be removed from"" the self along dimensions such as ""time, space, social distance, and hypotheticality."
"A repayment plan is a structured repaying of funds that have been loaned to an individual, business or government over either a standard or extended period of time, typically alongside a payment of interest."
"Repayment plans are prominent within the financial industry of a national economy where liquid funds are in high demand to assist in investment opportunities, governmental expenditure or personal finance."
The term first saw prominence with its use by the International Monetary Fund to describe its form of financial loan repayment from individual nations.
"Typically, the term ""repayment plan"" refers to the system of Federal Student Aid in the United States of America, which assists in covering tertiary education expenses of domestic students."
"A stick figure, also known as stickman, is a very simple drawing of a person or animal, composed of a few lines, curves, and dots."
"On a stick figure, the head is most often represented by a circle, sometimes embellished with details such as eyes, a mouth, or hair."
"The arms, legs, and torso are usually represented by straight lines."
"Details such as hands, feet, and a neck may be present or absent; simpler stick figures often display an ambiguous emotional expression or disproportionate limbs.The stick figure is a universally recognizable symbol, in all likelihood one of the most well known in the world."
"It transcends language, location, demographics, and can trace back its roots for almost 30 000 years."
"Its simplicity and versatility led to the stick figure being used for a variety of purposes – info graphics, signage, comics, animations, games, film storyboards, and visual media of all kinds all employ the stick figure."
"With the advent of the world wide web, the stick figure became a central element within an entire genre of web-based interactive entertainment known as flash animation."
"Over a period of more than two decades, stick figure animation impacted and shaped the visual landscape of the internet."
A wish is a hope or desire for something.
"In fiction, wishes can be used as plot devices."
"In folklore, opportunities for ""making a wish"" or for wishes to ""come true"" or ""be granted"" are themes that are sometimes used."
"Aka Manto (赤マント, Red Cloak), also known as Red Cape, Red Vest, Akai-Kami-Aoi-Kami (赤い紙青い紙, Red Paper, Blue Paper), or occasionally Aoi Manto (青マント, Blue Cloak), is a Japanese urban legend about a masked spirit who wears a red cloak, and who appears to people using toilets in public or school bathrooms."
"Accounts of the legend vary, but one consistent element of the story is that the spirit will ask the occupant of a toilet a question."
"In some versions, he will ask if they want red paper or blue paper, though other versions identify the choices as a red cloak or a blue cloak, or as a red cape or a blue cape."
"Choosing either option will result in the individual being killed, so the individual must ignore the spirit, run away, or reject both options in order to survive."
"An hourglass (or sandglass, sand timer, sand clock or egg timer) is a device used to measure the passage of time."
It comprises two glass bulbs connected vertically by a narrow neck that allows a regulated flow of a substance (historically sand) from the upper bulb to the lower one.
"Typically, the upper and lower bulbs are symmetric so that the hourglass will measure the same duration regardless of orientation."
"The specific duration of time a given hourglass measures is determined by factors including the quantity and coarseness of the particulate matter, the bulb size, and the neck width."
"Depictions of an hourglass as a symbol of the passage of time are found in art, especially on tombstones or other monuments, from antiquity to the present day."
"The form of a winged hourglass has been used as a literal depiction of the well-known idiom ""time flies""."
A match is a tool for starting a fire.
"Typically, matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper."
One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by friction generated by striking the match against a suitable surface.
"Wooden matches are packaged in matchboxes, and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks."
"The coated end of a match, known as the match ""head"", consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder; often colored for easier inspection."
"There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used."
"Snakes are elongated, limbless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes ."
"Like all other squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales."
"Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws."
"To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung."
Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.
"Lizards have evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly reduced limbs about twenty-five times independently via convergent evolution, leading to many lineages of legless lizards."
"These resemble snakes, but several common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia, Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae)."
"Living snakes are found on every continent except Antarctica, and on most smaller land masses; exceptions include some large islands, such as Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, the Hawaiian archipelago, and the islands of New Zealand, as well as many small islands of the Atlantic and central Pacific oceans."
"Additionally, sea snakes are widespread throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans."
"More than twenty families are currently recognized, comprising about 520 genera and about 3,900 species."
"They range in size from the tiny, 10.4 cm-long (4.1 in) Barbados threadsnake to the reticulated python of 6.95 meters (22.8 ft) in length."
The fossil species Titanoboa cerrejonensis was 12.8 meters (42 ft) long.
"Snakes are thought to have evolved from either burrowing or aquatic lizards, perhaps during the Jurassic period, with the earliest known fossils dating to between 143 and 167 Ma ago."
"The diversity of modern snakes appeared during the Paleocene epoch (c. 66 to 56 Ma ago, after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event)."
The oldest preserved descriptions of snakes can be found in the Brooklyn Papyrus.
Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.
Some possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to humans.
Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by constriction.
"A bouncy ball or rubber ball is a spherical toy ball, usually fairly small, made of elastic material which allows it to bounce against hard surfaces."
"When thrown against a hard surface, bouncy balls retain their momentum and much of their kinetic energy (or, if dropped, convert much of their potential energy to kinetic energy)."
They can thus rebound with an appreciable fraction of their original force.
"A berry is a small, pulpy, and often edible fruit."
"Typically, berries are juicy, rounded, brightly colored, sweet, sour or tart, and do not have a stone or pit, although many pips or seeds may be present."
"Common examples are strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, red currants, white currants and blackcurrants."
"In Britain, soft fruit is a horticultural term for such fruits.In common usage, the term ""berry"" differs from the scientific or botanical definition of a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower in which the outer layer of the ovary wall develops into an edible fleshy portion (pericarp)."
"The botanical definition includes many fruits that are not commonly known or referred to as berries, such as grapes, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, bananas, and chili peppers."
"Fruits commonly considered berries but excluded by the botanical definition include strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries, which are aggregate fruits and mulberries, which are multiple fruits."
"Watermelons and pumpkins are giant berries that fall into the category ""pepos""."
A plant bearing berries is said to be bacciferous or baccate.
"Berries are eaten worldwide and often used in jams, preserves, cakes, or pies."
Some berries are commercially important.
The berry industry varies from country to country as do types of berries cultivated or growing in the wild.
"Some berries such as raspberries and strawberries have been bred for hundreds of years and are distinct from their wild counterparts, while other berries, such as lingonberries and cloudberries, grow almost exclusively in the wild."
"While many berries are edible, some are poisonous to humans, such as deadly nightshade and pokeweed."
"Others, such as the white mulberry, red mulberry, and elderberry, are poisonous when unripe, but are edible when ripe."
"Manchester United Football Club is an English football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester."
"The club was formed as Newton Heath LYR Football Club, the works team of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot in Newton Heath, in 1878."
"The club split from the railway company in 1892 and remained under private ownership for almost 100 years, changing its name to Manchester United after being saved from bankruptcy in 1902."
"The club was the subject of takeover bids from media tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1984 and property trader Michael Knighton in 1989, before going public in 1991; they received another takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB corporation in 1998 before Malcolm Glazer's stake was announced in September 2003."
"By the end of 2003, Glazer had increased his shareholding from 3.17% to around 15%, which he almost doubled in the year up to October 2004."
"His acquisition of John Magnier and J. P. McManus's 28.7% stake in May 2005 pushed his own up to around 57%, well over the 30% threshold that would force him to launch a takeover bid."
"A few days later, he took control of 75% of the club's shares, allowing him to delist the company from the stock exchange, and within a month, the Glazers took 98% ownership of the club via their Red Football parent company, forcing a squeeze-out of the remaining 2%."
The final purchase price of the club totalled almost £800 million.
"Most of the capital used by Glazer to purchase Manchester United came in the form of loans, the majority of which were secured against the club's assets, incurring interest payments of over £60 million per annum."
"The remainder came in the form of PIK loans (payment in kind loans), which were later sold to hedge funds."
"Manchester United was not liable for the PIKs, which were held by Red Football Joint Venture and were secured on that company's shares in Red Football (and thus the club)."
The interest on the PIKs rolled up at 14.25% per annum.
"Despite this, the Glazers did not pay down any of the PIK loans in the first five years they owned the club."
"In January 2010, the club carried out a successful £500 million bond issue, and by March 2010, the PIKs stood at around £207 million."
The PIKs were eventually paid off in November 2010 by unspecified means.
"In August 2012, as part of further refinancing, the Glazers sold a number of shares in Manchester United in an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Some Manchester United fans opposed Glazer's takeover of the club, particularly once they realised the level of debt that the club would have to take on after having been debt-free for so many years."
Disgruntled fans launched the football club F.C.
"United of Manchester in 2005, which entered the North West Counties Football League and played in the sixth tier National League North from 2015 to 2019."
"Since 2005, the Manchester United Supporters' Trust has been working on a way of returning ownership of the club to supporters; in 2010, they met with a group of wealthy Manchester United fans – dubbed the ""Red Knights"" – to discuss a billion-pound takeover bid."
"However, the bid fell through when the Red Knights refused to meet the Glazers' valuation of the club."
"Kangaroo rats, small mostly nocturnal rodents of genus Dipodomys, are native to arid areas of western North America."
The common name derives from their bipedal form.
"They hop in a manner similar to the much larger kangaroo, but developed this mode of locomotion independently, like several other clades of rodents (e.g."
dipodids and hopping mice).
"A harbor (American English), harbour (British English; see spelling differences), or haven is a sheltered body of water where ships, boats, and barges can be docked."
"The term harbor is often used interchangeably with port, which is a man-made facility built for loading and unloading vessels and dropping off and picking up passengers."
Ports usually include one or more harbors.
Alexandria Port in Egypt is an example of a port with two harbors.
Harbors may be natural or artificial.
"An artificial harbor can have deliberately constructed breakwaters, sea walls, or jettys or they can be constructed by dredging, which requires maintenance by further periodic dredging."
"An example of an artificial harbor is Long Beach Harbor, California, United States, which was an array of salt marshes and tidal flats too shallow for modern merchant ships before it was first dredged in the early 20th century."
"In contrast, a natural harbor is surrounded on several sides by prominences of land."
"Examples of natural harbors include Sydney Harbour, Australia and Trincomalee Harbour in Sri Lanka."
"Spiders (order Araneae) are air-breathing arthropods that have eight legs, chelicerae with fangs generally able to inject venom, and spinnerets that extrude silk."
They are the largest order of arachnids and rank seventh in total species diversity among all orders of organisms.
"Spiders are found worldwide on every continent except for Antarctica, and have become established in nearly every land habitat."
"As of August 2021, 49,623 spider species in 129 families have been recorded by taxonomists."
"However, there has been dissension within the scientific community as to how all these families should be classified, as evidenced by the over 20 different classifications that have been proposed since 1900.Anatomically, spiders (as with all arachnids) differ from other arthropods in that the usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax or prosoma, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, however, as there is currently neither paleontological nor embryological evidence that spiders ever had a separate thorax-like division, there exists an argument against the validity of the term cephalothorax, which means fused cephalon (head) and the thorax."
"Similarly, arguments can be formed against use of the term abdomen, as the opisthosoma of all spiders contains a heart and respiratory organs, organs atypical of an abdomen.Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae."
"In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax."
"Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure."
Their abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of glands.
"Spider webs vary widely in size, shape and the amount of sticky thread used."
"It now appears that the spiral orb web may be one of the earliest forms, and spiders that produce tangled cobwebs are more abundant and diverse than orb-weaver spiders."
"Spider-like arachnids with silk-producing spigots appeared in the Devonian period about 386 million years ago, but these animals apparently lacked spinnerets."
"True spiders have been found in Carboniferous rocks from 318 to 299 million years ago, and are very similar to the most primitive surviving suborder, the Mesothelae."
"The main groups of modern spiders, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae, first appeared in the Triassic period, before 200 million years ago."
"The species Bagheera kiplingi was described as herbivorous in 2008, but all other known species are predators, mostly preying on insects and on other spiders, although a few large species also take birds and lizards."
It is estimated that the world's 25 million tons of spiders kill 400–800 million tons of prey per year.
"Spiders use a wide range of strategies to capture prey: trapping it in sticky webs, lassoing it with sticky bolas, mimicking the prey to avoid detection, or running it down."
"Most detect prey mainly by sensing vibrations, but the active hunters have acute vision, and hunters of the genus Portia show signs of intelligence in their choice of tactics and ability to develop new ones."
"Spiders' guts are too narrow to take solids, so they liquefy their food by flooding it with digestive enzymes."
"They also grind food with the bases of their pedipalps, as arachnids do not have the mandibles that crustaceans and insects have."
"To avoid being eaten by the females, which are typically much larger, male spiders identify themselves to potential mates by a variety of complex courtship rituals."
"Males of most species survive a few matings, limited mainly by their short life spans."
"Females weave silk egg-cases, each of which may contain hundreds of eggs."
"Females of many species care for their young, for example by carrying them around or by sharing food with them."
"A minority of species are social, building communal webs that may house anywhere from a few to 50,000 individuals."
"Social behavior ranges from precarious toleration, as in the widow spiders, to co-operative hunting and food-sharing."
"Although most spiders live for at most two years, tarantulas and other mygalomorph spiders can live up to 25 years in captivity."
"While the venom of a few species is dangerous to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom in medicine and as non-polluting pesticides."
"Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these can be used as silk factories."
"As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers."
An irrational fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.
"Editing is the process of selecting and preparing written, photographic, visual, audible, or cinematic material used by a person or an entity to convey a message or information."
"The editing process can involve correction, condensation, organisation, and many other modifications performed with an intention of producing a correct, consistent, accurate and complete piece of work.The editing process often begins with the author's idea for the work itself, continuing as a collaboration between the author and the editor as the work is created."
"Editing can involve creative skills, human relations and a precise set of methods."
There are various editorial positions in publishing.
"Typically, one finds editorial assistants reporting to the senior-level editorial staff and directors who report to senior executive editors."
Senior executive editors are responsible for developing a product for its final release.
"The smaller the publication, the more these roles overlap."
"The top editor at many publications may be known as the chief editor, executive editor, or simply the editor."
A frequent and highly regarded contributor to a magazine may acquire the title of editor-at-large or contributing editor.
"Mid-level newspaper editors often manage or help to manage sections, such as business, sports and features."
"In U.S. newspapers, the level below the top editor is usually the managing editor."
"In the book publishing industry, editors may organize anthologies and other compilations, produce definitive editions of a classic author's works (scholarly editor), and organize and manage contributions to a multi-author book (symposium editor or volume editor)."
Obtaining manuscripts or recruiting authors is the role of an acquisitions editor or a commissioning editor in a publishing house.
Finding marketable ideas and presenting them to appropriate authors are the responsibilities of a sponsoring editor.
"Copy editors correct spelling, grammar and align writings to house style."
"Changes to the publishing industry since the 1980s have resulted in nearly all copy editing of book manuscripts being outsourced to freelance copy editors.At newspapers and wire services, press or copy editors write headlines and work on more substantive issues, such as ensuring accuracy, fairness, and taste."
"In some positions, they design pages and select news stories for inclusion."
"At U.K. and Australian newspapers, the term is sub-editor."
They may choose the layout of the publication and communicate with the printer.
These editors may have the title of layout or design editor or (more so in the past) makeup editor.
"Lizards (suborder Lacertilia) are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains."
The group is paraphyletic as it excludes the snakes and Amphisbaenia; some lizards are more closely related to these two excluded groups than they are to other lizards.
Lizards range in size from chameleons and geckos a few centimeters long to the 3 meter long Komodo dragon.
"Most lizards are quadrupedal, running with a strong side-to-side motion."
"Some lineages (known as ""legless lizards""), have secondarily lost their legs, and have long snake-like bodies."
Some such as the forest-dwelling Draco lizards are able to glide.
"They are often territorial, the males fighting off other males and signalling, often with brightly colours, to attract mates and to intimidate rivals."
"Lizards are mainly carnivorous, often being sit-and-wait predators; many smaller species eat insects, while the Komodo eats mammals as big as water buffalo."
"Lizards make use of a variety of antipredator adaptations, including venom, camouflage, reflex bleeding, and the ability to sacrifice and regrow their tails."
Chess is a board game played between two players.
"It is sometimes called Western chess, or International chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi and shogi."
"The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century after evolving from a similar, much older game of Indian origin."
"Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide."
Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information.
It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid.
"At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns."
"The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ""check"") and there is no way for it to escape."
There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.
Organized chess arose in the 19th century.
Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (International Chess Federation).
"The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion."
A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game's inception.
"Aspects of art are found in chess composition; and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics, computer science, and psychology."
One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine.
"In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov."
"Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players, and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory."
"A lifeboat or liferaft is a small, rigid or inflatable boat carried for emergency evacuation in the event of a disaster aboard a ship."
Lifeboat drills are required by law on larger commercial ships.
Rafts  (liferafts) are also used.
"In the military, a lifeboat may double as a whaleboat, dinghy, or gig."
The ship's tenders of cruise ships often double as lifeboats.
"Recreational sailors usually carry inflatable liferafts, though a few prefer small proactive lifeboats that are harder to sink and can be sailed to safety."
Inflatable lifeboats may be equipped with auto-inflation (carbon dioxide or nitrogen) canisters or mechanical pumps.
"A quick release and pressure release mechanism is fitted on ships so that the canister or pump automatically inflates the lifeboat, and the lifeboat breaks free of the sinking vessel."
Commercial aircraft are also required to carry auto-inflating liferafts in case of an emergency water landing; offshore oil platforms also have liferafts.
"Ship-launched lifeboats are lowered from davits on a ship's deck, and are hard to sink in normal circumstances."
"The cover serves as protection from sun, wind and rain, can be used to collect rainwater, and is normally made of a reflective or fluorescent material that is highly visible."
"Lifeboats have oars, flares and mirrors for signaling, first aid supplies, and food and water for several days."
"Some lifeboats are more capably equipped to permit self-rescue, with supplies such as a radio, an engine and sail, heater, navigational equipment, solar water stills, rainwater catchments and fishing equipment."
The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and the International Life-Saving Appliance Code (LSA) requires certain emergency equipment be carried on each lifeboat and liferaft used on international voyages.
Modern lifeboats carry an Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) and either a radar reflector or Search and Rescue Transponder (SART).
"Feces (or faeces) is the solid or semi-solid remains of food that was not digested in the small intestine, and has been broken down by bacteria in the large intestine."
"Feces contains a relatively small amount of metabolic waste products such as bacterially altered bilirubin, and dead epithelial cells from the lining of the gut.Feces is discharged through the anus or cloaca during defecation."
Feces can be used as fertilizer or soil conditioner in agriculture.
It can also be burned as fuel or dried and used for construction.
Some medicinal uses have been found.
"In the case of human feces, fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy are in use."
Urine and feces together are called excreta.
A brake is a mechanical device that inhibits motion by absorbing energy from a moving system.
"It is used for slowing or stopping a moving vehicle, wheel, axle, or to prevent its motion, most often accomplished by means of friction."
"Dirt  is an unclean matter, especially when in contact with a person's clothes, skin, or possessions."
"In such cases, they are said to become dirty."
"Common types of dirt include:

Dust: a general powder of organic or mineral matter
Filth: foul matter such as excrement
Grime: a black, ingrained dust such as soot
Soil: the mix of clay, sand, and humus which lies on top of bedrock."
The term 'soil' may be used to refer to unwanted substances or dirt that are deposited onto surfaces such as clothing.
Knight-service was a form of feudal land tenure under which a knight held a fief or estate of land termed a knight's fee (fee being synonymous with fief) from an overlord conditional on him as tenant performing military service for his overlord.
A firstborn (also known as an eldest child or sometimes firstling) is the first child born to in the birth order of a couple through childbirth.
"Historically, the role of the firstborn child has been socially significant, particularly for a firstborn son in patriarchal societies."
"In law, many systems have incorporated the concept of primogeniture, wherein the firstborn child inherits their parent's property."
"The firstborn in Judaism, the bechor, is also accorded a special position."
"While an only child will by definition also always be the ""firstborn"", in larger families the firstborn often perceives himself or herself to be treated differently from later children."
Huger is a surname of French origin.
"It may refer to:

Five brothers from a prominent South Carolina family of Huguenot descent who served in the American Revolution:

Benjamin Huger (American Revolution), killed near Charleston
Daniel Huger, member of the Continental Congress and United States Congress
Francis Huger (1751–1811)
Isaac Huger, a Continental Army officer, Continental Congressman and United States Marshal
John Huger (1744–1804)And their descendants:

Benjamin Huger (congressman), a United States Representative from South Carolina
Francis Kinloch Huger, a physician and artillery officer
Benjamin Huger (general), a United States Army and Confederate Army officer from South Carolina
Daniel Elliott Huger, a United States Representative from South Carolina
Thomas B. Huger, a United States Navy and Confederate Navy officer from South Carolina"
"Naruto: Shippuden is an anime series mainly adapted from Part II of Masashi Kishimoto's original manga series, with exactly 500 episodes."
"It is set two and a half years after the original series in the Naruto universe, following the ninja teenager Naruto Uzumaki and his allies."
"The series is directed by Hayato Date, and produced by Pierrot and TV Tokyo."
"It began broadcasting on February 15, 2007 on TV Tokyo, and concluded on March 23, 2017.On January 2, 2009, Viz Media and Crunchyroll provided eight uncut English subtitled Naruto: Shippuden episodes on the official Naruto website."
"Later on January 15, Viz began providing subtitled versions of the latest Naruto: Shippuden episodes a week after they first aired in Japan, with a new episode being added to the Naruto website each subsequent Thursday."
"The English dub of Naruto: Shippuden made its US premiere on Disney XD on October 28, 2009."
"On July 24, 2009, Viz Media announced that the series would be released on the iTunes Store."
"The first DVD release of the series in North America was released on September 29, 2009.Naruto: Shippuden stopped airing on Disney XD on November 5, 2011 after 98 episodes, in which the network cited more frequent violence that was shown in later episodes."
DVD box sets generally containing thirteen dubbed episodes from episode 1 onward were released quarterly in their uncut format.
"The English dub was streamed on the Neon Alley web channel from its launch in October 2012, and beginning December 29, 2012 with episode 99, dubbed episodes premiered every week uncut until March 25, 2016 after 338 episodes, about a month before Neon Alley's closure."
"Adult Swim's Toonami programming block began airing the anime from the beginning on January 5, 2014 in an uncut format and as of 2021 it is still running on a weekly basis."
The network started showing never before aired dubbed episodes at the 339th episode mark by May 2021.
"In four regions, episodes from the series have been released on DVD and Blu-ray by single volumes and box sets."
"In North America, twelve single volumes and thirty eight box sets have been released."
"In the United Kingdom, twenty eight single volumes and six box sets have been released."
"In Japan, twenty six sets of volumes have been released based on which arc it represents."
"In Australia and New Zealand, twenty-eight collections have been released."
Apes (Hominoidea ) are a branch of Old World tailless simians native to Africa and Southeast Asia.
"They are the sister group of the Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade."
They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation.
"In traditional and non-scientific use, the term ""ape"" excludes humans, and can include tailless primates taxonomically considered monkeys (such as the Barbary ape and black ape), and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon Hominoidea."
"There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes."
"The family Hylobatidae, the lesser apes, include four genera and a total of sixteen species of gibbon, including the lar gibbon and the siamang, all native to Asia."
They are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground.
They have lighter bodies and smaller social groups than great apes.
"The family Hominidae (hominids), the great apes, include four genera comprising three extant species of orangutans and their subspecies, two extant species of gorillas and their subspecies, two extant species of panins (bonobos and chimpanzees) and their subspecies, and one extant species of humans in a single extant subspecies.Except for gorillas and humans, hominoids are agile climbers of trees."
"Apes eat a variety of plant and animal foods, with the majority of food being plant foods, which can include fruit, leaves, stalks, roots and seeds, including nuts and grass seeds."
Human diets are sometimes substantially different from that of other hominoids due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation.
"Humans are by far the most numerous of the hominoid species, in fact outnumbering all other primates by a factor of several thousand to one."
All non-human hominoids are rare and endangered.
"The chief threat to most of the endangered species is loss of tropical rainforest habitat, though some populations are further imperiled by hunting for bushmeat."
The great apes of Africa are also facing threat from the Ebola virus.
"Currently considered to be the greatest threat to survival of African apes, Ebola infection is responsible for the death of at least one third of all gorillas and chimpanzees since 1990."
"A puppet is an object, often resembling a human, animal or mythical figure, that is animated or manipulated by a person called a puppeteer."
"The puppeteer uses movements of their hands, arms, or control devices such as rods or strings to move the body, head, limbs, and in some cases the mouth and eyes of the puppet."
"The puppeteer often speaks in the voice of the character of the puppet, and then synchronizes the movements of the puppet's mouth with this spoken part."
"The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling."
Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece.
"There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use."
They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex.
"Two simple types of puppets are the finger puppet, which is a tiny puppet that fits onto a single finger, and the sock puppet, which is formed and operated by inserting one's hand inside a sock, with the opening and closing of the hand simulating the movement of the puppet's ""mouth."""
"The sock puppet is a type of hand puppet, which is controlled using one hand that occupies the interior of the puppet and moves the puppet around."
"A ""live-hand puppet"" is similar to a hand puppet but is larger and requires two puppeteers for each puppet."
"A Marionette is a much more complicated type of puppet that is suspended and controlled by a number of strings connected to the head, back and limbs, plus sometimes a central rod attached to a control bar held from above by the puppeteer."
A rod puppet is constructed around a central rod secured to the head.
A shadow puppet is a cut-out figure held between a source of light and a translucent screen.
Bunraku puppets are a type of Japanese wood-carved puppet.
"A ventriloquist's dummy is a puppet, often human-shaped, operated by a ventriloquist performer's hand; the performer produces the puppet's voice with little or no movement of her mouth, which creates the illusion that the puppet is alive."
"Carnival puppets are large puppets, typically bigger than a human, designed to be part of a large spectacle or parade."
Protection is any measure taken to guard a thing against damage caused by outside forces.
"Protection can be provided to physical objects, including organisms, to systems, and to intangible things like civil and political rights."
"Although the mechanisms for providing protection vary widely, the basic meaning of the term remains the same."
"This is illustrated by an explanation found in a manual on electrical wiring:

The meaning of the word protection, as used in the electrical industry, is no different to that in everyday use."
People protect themselves against personal or financial loss by means of insurance and from injury or discomfort by the use of protective clothing.
They further protect their property by the installation of security measures such as locks and/or alarm systems.
"Some kind of protection is a characteristic of all life, as living things have evolved at least some protective mechanisms to counter damaging environmental phenomena, such as ultraviolet light."
"Biological membranes such as bark on trees and skin on animals offer protection from various threats, with skin playing a key role in protecting organisms against pathogens and excessive water loss."
"Additional structures like scales and hair offer further protection from the elements and from predators, with some animals having features such as spines or camouflage serving exclusively as anti-predator adaptations."
Many animals supplement the protection afforded by their physiology by burrowing or otherwise adopting habitats or behaviors that insulate them from potential sources of harm.
Humans originally began wearing clothing and building shelters in prehistoric times for protection from the elements.
"Both humans and animals are also often concerned with the protection of others, with adult animals being particularly inclined to seek to protect their young from elements of nature and from predators."
"In the human sphere of activity, the concept of protection has been extended to nonliving objects, including technological systems such as computers, and to intangible things such as intellectual property, beliefs, and economic systems."
"Humans seek to protect locations of historical and cultural significance through historic preservation efforts, and are also concerned with protecting the environment from damage caused by human activity, and with protecting the Earth as a whole from potentially harmful objects from space."
Heads of state throughout the world and at all periods of history may be ranked according to characteristics such as length of time holding that position; age of accession or death; or physical attributes.
"In this way world records in these characteristics may be identified, although the historical basis for such claims is frequently uncertain."
"A beard is the hair that grows on the jaw, chin, upper lip, lower lip, cheeks, and neck of humans and some non-human animals."
"In humans, usually pubescent or adult males are able to grow beards."
"Some women with hirsutism, a hormonal condition of excessive hairiness, may develop a beard."
"Throughout the course of history, societal attitudes toward male beards have varied widely depending on factors such as prevailing cultural-religious traditions and the current era's fashion trends."
Some religions (such as Islam and Sikhism) have considered a full beard to be essential and mandate it as part of their observance.
"Other cultures, even while not officially mandating it, view a beard as central to a man's virility, exemplifying such virtues as wisdom, strength, sexual prowess and high social status."
"In cultures where facial hair is uncommon (or currently out of fashion), beards may be associated with poor hygiene or an uncivilized, dangerous demeanor."
"In countries with colder climates, beards help protect the wearer's face from the elements."
"Mammillaria pottsii, also known as fox-tail cactus or rat-tail nipple cactus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cactaceae."
"It was first described by Scheer ex Salm-Dyck, Cact."
Hort.
"1849: 104 (1850) According to the United Nations Environment Programme, M. leona is a synonym for M. pottsii."
"Rhododendron menziesii, also classified as Menziesia ferruginea, is a species of flowering plant in the heath family Ericaceae, known by several common names, including rusty menziesia, false huckleberry, fool's huckleberry and mock azalea."
"Ricardo Valdez Valentine Jr. (born June 24, 1992), known professionally as 6lack (stylized as 6LACK, pronounced ""black""), is an American singer and songwriter."
"He initially gained notable recognition following the release of his single, ""Prblms"", taken from his debut album, Free 6lack, which was released in November 2016."
"He released his second album, East Atlanta Love Letter in September 2018, which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 chart."
"Later that year, he released the single ""OTW"" (with Khalid and Ty Dolla Sign)."
"6lack was featured on the Normani single ""Waves"", which earned him a MTV Video Music Award."
"In June 2020, he released the EP 6pc Hot, which included the single, ""Know My Rights"" (featuring Lil Baby)."
"Later that year he was featured on the Gorillaz track ""The Pink Phantom"", with Sir Elton John."
"In 2021, his single ""Calling My Phone"" (featuring Lil Tjay), topped the charts in Canada, and peaked at number three in the US."
6lack is currently signed to Love Renaissance and Interscope Records.
"He is also a member of the Atlanta-Baltimore music collective Spillage Village, founded by EarthGang and JID."
6lack has received three Grammy Award nominations and has won an MTV Video Music Award.
A process is a series or set of activities that interact to produce a result; it may occur once-only or be recurrent or periodic.
Things called a process include:
"A lieutenant governor, lieutenant-governor, or vice governor is a high officer of state, whose precise role and rank vary by jurisdiction."
"Often a lieutenant governor is the deputy, or lieutenant, to or ranked under a governor — a ""second-in-command"", rather like deputy governor."
"In Canadian provinces or in the Dutch Caribbean, the lieutenant governor is the representative of the monarch in that jurisdiction.In India, lieutenant governors are in charge of special administrative divisions in that country.In the United States, lieutenant governors are usually second-in-command to a state governor, and the actual power held by the lieutenant governor varies greatly from state to state."
"The lieutenant governor is often first in line of succession to the governorship, and acts as governor when the governor leaves the state or is unable to serve."
"Also, the lieutenant governor is often the president of the state senate."
"Clayton ""Peg Leg"" Bates (October 11, 1907 – December 6, 1998) was an African-American entertainer from Fountain Inn, South Carolina, United States."
"The ease of doing business index was an index created jointly by Simeon Djankov, Michael Klein, and Caralee McLiesh, three leading economists at the World Bank Group."
"The academic research for the report was done jointly with professors Edward Glaeser, Oliver Hart, and Andrei Shleifer."
"Higher rankings (a low numerical value) indicated better, usually simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property rights."
Empirical research funded by the World Bank to justify their work show that the economic growth impact of improving these regulations is strong.
"Though the first report was authored by Djankov, Klein, and McLiesh, and they continue to be listed as ""founders"" of the report, some sources attribute the genesis of the idea to Djankov and Gerhard Pohl."
"The report was discontinued by the World Bank on September 16, 2021, following the release of an independent audit of the data irregularities."
The audit documented how bank leadership pressured experts to manipulate the results of the 2018 and 2020 Doing Business Reports.
"Noise is unwanted sound considered unpleasant, loud or disruptive to hearing."
"From a physics standpoint, there is no distinction between noise and desired sound, as both are vibrations through a medium, such as air or water."
"The difference arises when the brain receives and perceives a sound.Acoustic noise is any sound in the acoustic domain, either deliberate (e.g., music or speech) or unintended."
"In contrast, noise in electronics may not be audible to the human ear and may require instruments for detection.In audio engineering, noise can refer to the unwanted residual electronic noise signal that gives rise to acoustic noise heard as a hiss."
"This signal noise is commonly measured using A-weighting or ITU-R 468 weighting.In experimental sciences, noise can refer to any random fluctuations of data that hinders perception of a signal."
"Glass is a non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid, that has widespread practical, technological, and decorative use in, for example, window panes, tableware, and optics."
Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling (quenching) of the molten form; some glasses such as volcanic glass are naturally occurring.
"The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are ""silicate glasses"" based on the chemical compound silica (silicon dioxide, or quartz), the primary constituent of sand."
"Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, accounts for around 90% of manufactured glass."
"The term glass, in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology."
"Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material."
"Although brittle, buried silicate glass will survive for very long periods if not disturbed, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures."
"Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BC in Mesopotamia, Egypt, or Syria."
"The earliest known glass objects were beads, perhaps created accidentally during metalworking or the production of faience."
"Due to its ease of formability into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels, such as bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses."
"In its most solid forms, it has also been used for paperweights and marbles."
Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed as enamelled glass.
"The refractive, reflective and transmission properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing optical lenses, prisms, and optoelectronics materials."
"Extruded glass fibres have application as optical fibres in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as glass wool so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic (fibreglass)."
Claytonia perfoliata (syn.
"Montia perfoliata), also known as miner's lettuce, Indian lettuce, spring beauty, winter purslane, or palsingat, is a flowering plant in the family Montiaceae."
"It is a fleshy, herbaceous, annual plant native to the western mountain and coastal regions of North America, from southernmost Alaska and central British Columbia, all the way south to Central America, but most common in California in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin Valleys."
"Together with Claytonia parviflora and C. rubra, C. perfoliata comprises what is almost certainly a polyploid pillar complex, which is based on three diploid species."
Two key studies on the population ecology and genetics of the C. perfoliata complex were published in 2012.
"A laborer is a person who works in manual labor types, especially in the construction and factory industries' workforce."
"Laborers are in a class of wage-earners in which their only possession of significant material value is their labor, this is the proletariat."
"Industries employing laborers include building things such as roads, buildings, bridges, tunnels, and railway tracks."
"Laborers work with blasting tools, hand tools, power tools, air tools, and small heavy equipment, and act as assistants to other trades as well  such as operators or cement masons."
The 1st century BC engineer Vitruvius writes that a good crew of laborers is just as valuable as any other aspect of construction.
"Other than the addition of pneumatics, laborer practices have changed little."
"With the introduction of field technologies, the laborers have been quick to adapt to the use of this technology as being laborers' work."
"""The Walk In"" is the third episode of the second season of the American television drama series The Americans, and the 16th overall episode of the series."
"It originally aired on FX in the United States on March 12, 2014."
A bedroom is a room situated within a residential or accommodation unit characterised by its usage for sleeping.
"A typical western bedroom contains as bedroom furniture one or two beds (ranging from a crib for an infant, a single or twin bed for a toddler, child, teenager, or single adult to bigger sizes like a full, double, queen, king or California king [eastern or waterbed size for a couple]), a clothes closet, and bedside table and dressing table, both of which usually contain drawers."
"Except in bungalows, ranch style homes, or one-storey motels, bedrooms are usually on one of the floors of a dwelling that is above ground level."
"A crew is a body or a class of people who work at a common activity, generally in a structured or hierarchical organization."
A location in which a crew works is called a crewyard or a workyard.
"The word has nautical resonances: the tasks involved in operating a ship, particularly a sailing ship, providing numerous specialities within a ship's crew, often organised with a chain of command."
"Traditional nautical usage strongly distinguishes officers from crew, though the two groups combined form the ship's company."
Members of a crew are often referred to by the title Crewman.
"Crew also refers to the sport of rowing, where teams row competitively in racing shells."
A daughter is a female offspring; a girl or woman in relation to her parents.
Daughterhood is the state of being someone's daughter.
The male counterpart is a son.
Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements.
"From biological perspective, a daughter is a first degree relative."
"The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it, one of these being used in reference to a female descendant or consanguinity."
It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.
"In patriarchal societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons."
A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters and subject daughters to female infanticide.
"In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a bride price."
"The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman and is known as a dowry."
The payment of a dowry can be found in societies where women do not labour outside the home.
The Aston Martin Vanquish is a grand tourer introduced by British luxury automobile manufacturer Aston Martin in 2001 as a successor to the Aston Martin Vantage (1993).
"The first-generation of the ""V12 Vanquish,"" designed by Ian Callum and unveiled at the 2001 Geneva Motor Show, was produced from 2001 to 2007 as the flagship of the marque."
"The concept car, known as ""Project Vantage"" and the first Aston Martin design wholly styled by Callum, was built by the Ford Motor Company with craftsman Dilip Chhabria to display the company's vision for a future sports car to represent Aston Martin after the discontinuation of the Virage-based Vantage."
"The V12 Vanquish closely resembled the concept car, and featured carbon fibre and alloy construction, Aston Martin's most powerful V12 engine, and host of new technologies."
A specially modified V12 Vanquish was driven by James Bond in the 2002 film Die Another Day.
"In 2004, a mildly updated version of the first-generation model named ""V12 Vanquish S"" was introduced featuring a more highly tuned engine and more track-oriented ride and handling."
The V12 Vanquish was indirectly replaced by the DBS after 2007.
"The second-generation Vanquish was introduced in 2012, based on the Aston Martin's VH platform, followed in 2017 by a ""Vanquish S"" with a more powerful engine and improved aerodynamics."
The second-generation Vanquish was succeeded by the DBS Superleggera in 2018.
"A litter box, sometimes called a sandbox, cat box, litter tray, cat pan, or litter pan, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats, as well as rabbits, ferrets, miniature pigs, small dogs, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository."
They are provided for pets that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to excrete their metabolic waste.
"Many owners of these animals prefer not to let them roam outside for fear that they might succumb to outdoor dangers, whilst others prevent outdoor visits in order to avoid the potentially negative effect on local wildlife of cats."
"On average, indoor cats have a lifespan of 16.8 years while outdoor cats' lives are much shorter, only 5.6 years."
"These outdoor dangers include weather, wildlife, traffic or diseases such as the feline immunodeficiency virus.In the wild, cats naturally excrete in soft or sandy soil for easy burial."
They use their paws in a backward sweeping motion to cover their feces.
"To stimulate this instinctive desire, a litter box's bottom is typically filled with 2 inches (5 cm) or less of cat litter."
"Litter box filler is a loose, granular material that absorbs moisture and odors such as ammonia."
"Some litter brands contain baking soda to absorb such odors, or owners may sprinkle a thin layer in the bottom of the box, under the cat litter."
The litter material also satisfies a cat's instinctive desire to hide their scent by allowing them to bury their waste.
"The most common material is clay, although recycled paper ""pellets"" and silica-based ""crystal"" variants are also used."
"Sometimes, when an owner wishes to stimulate the cat's natural instincts, natural dirt is used."
"The cat-box that the litter is poured into can give off a strong odor, if not disposed of properly."
"It is recommended that the litter box be kept in low traffic areas of the home, such as a basement or laundry room to avoid litter box aversion."
There are commercially available special types of litter to help cover or lessen the odor produced.
"They contain baking soda, plant extracts and/or odorized crystals."
"If kept in a room with an intake vent, an air freshener may be added on the furnace filter to isolate the odor from the rest of the house."
"Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent)."
"It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients."
"Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.
"""Water"" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure."
A number of natural states of water exist.
It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog.
"Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state."
"When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow."
The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
"Water covers approximately 70.9% of the Earth's surface, mostly in seas and oceans."
"Small portions of water occur as groundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%)."
"Water moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea."
Water plays an important role in the world economy.
Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.
Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world.
"Much of the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, lakes, and canals."
"Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in industry and homes."
"Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing."
"Water, ice and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing."
A pocket is a bag- or envelope-like receptacle either fastened to or inserted in an article of clothing to hold small items.
"Pockets are also  attached to luggage, backpacks, and similar items."
"In older usage, a pocket was a separate small bag or pouch."
A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
"Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods.Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them."
The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
Cars became widely available in the early 20th century.
"One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company."
"Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts."
"In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lights."
"Over the decades, additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex."
"These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment."
"Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels."
"Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy than gasoline cars before 2025."
"The transition from fossil fuels to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios, such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.There are costs and benefits to car use."
"The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance, fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance."
"The costs to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution, public health, healthcare, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life."
"Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.Personal benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and convenience."
"Societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from taxes."
People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.
There are around 1 billion cars in use worldwide.
"Car usage is increasing rapidly, especially in China, India, and other newly industrialized countries."
"Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, to the simplest pleasure."
"An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love for food."
"Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of a strong attraction and emotional attachment.Love is considered to be both positive and negative, with its virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection, as ""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"" and its vice representing human moral flaw, akin to vanity, selfishness, amour-propre, and egotism, as potentially leading people into a type of mania, obsessiveness or codependency."
"It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self, or animals."
"In its various forms, love acts as a major facilitator of interpersonal relationships and, owing to its central psychological importance, is one of the most common themes in the creative arts."
"Love has been postulated to be a function that keeps human beings together against menaces and to facilitate the continuation of the species.Ancient Greek philosophers identified six forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), self-love (Philautia), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape)."
"Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love."
"Numerous cultures have also distinguished Ren, Yuanfen, Mamihlapinatapai, Cafuné, Kama, Bhakti, Mettā, Ishq, Chesed, Amore, Charity, Saudade (and other variants or symbioses of these states), as culturally unique words, definitions, or expressions of love in regards to a specified ""moments"" currently lacking in the English language.Scientific research on emotion has increased significantly over the past two decades."
"The color wheel theory of love defines three primary, three secondary and nine tertiary love styles, describing them in terms of the traditional color wheel."
"The triangular theory of love suggests ""intimacy, passion and commitment"" are core components of love."
Love has additional religious or spiritual meaning.
"This diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states."
"A funeral director, also known as an undertaker (British English) or mortician (American English), is a professional involved in the business of funeral rites."
"These tasks often entail the embalming and burial or cremation of the dead, as well as the arrangements for the funeral ceremony (although not the directing and conducting of the funeral itself unless clergy are not present)."
"Funeral directors may at times be asked to perform tasks such as dressing (in garments usually suitable for daily wear), casketing (placing the corpse in the coffin), and cossetting (applying any sort of cosmetic or substance to the best viewable areas of the corpse for the purpose of enhancing its appearance)."
A funeral director may work at a funeral home or be an independent employee.
The leg extension is a resistance weight training exercise that targets the quadriceps muscle in the legs.
The exercise is done using a machine called the Leg Extension Machine.
There are various manufacturers of these machines and each one is slightly different.
Most gym and weight rooms will have the machine in their facility.
"The leg extension is an isolated exercise targeting one specific muscle group, the quadriceps."
"It should not be considered as a total leg workout, such as the squat or deadlift."
"The exercise consists of bending the leg at the knee and extending the legs, then lowering them back to the original position."
"Primitive Baptists – also known as Hard Shell Baptists, Foot Washing Baptists or Old School Baptists – are conservative Baptists adhering to a degree of Calvinist beliefs who coalesced out of the controversy among Baptists in the early 19th century over the appropriateness of mission boards, tract societies, and temperance societies."
"The adjective ""primitive"" in the name is used in the sense of ""original""."
The facial artery (external maxillary artery in older texts) is a branch of the external carotid artery that supplies structures of the superficial face.
"A park is an area of natural, semi-natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats."
Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities.
National parks and country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside.
State parks and provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies.
"Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures."
"Many parks have fields for playing sports such as baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball."
"Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities."
Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area.
Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.
"The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometers (or square miles), with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers."
"In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit."
"Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions (e.g."
rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles).
Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger.
"Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months."
"There are also amusement parks that have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill."
"The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), also called the varying hare or snowshoe rabbit, is a species of hare found in North America."
"It has the name ""snowshoe"" because of the large size of its hind feet."
The animal's feet prevent it from sinking into the snow when it hops and walks.
Its feet also have fur on the soles to protect it from freezing temperatures.
"For camouflage, its fur turns white during the winter and rusty brown during the summer."
Its flanks are white year-round.
The snowshoe hare is also distinguishable by the black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears.
Its ears are shorter than those of most other hares.
"In summer, it feeds on plants such as grass, ferns, and leaves; in winter, it eats twigs, the bark from trees, and plants and, similar to the Arctic hare, has been known to occasionally eat dead animals."
It can sometimes be seen feeding in small groups.
This animal is mainly active at night and does not hibernate.
"The snowshoe hare may have up to four litters in a year, which average three to eight young."
"Males compete for females, and females may breed with several males."
A major predator of the snowshoe hare is the Canada lynx.
"Historical records of animals caught by fur hunters over hundreds of years show the lynx and hare numbers rising and falling in a cycle, which has made the hare known to biology students worldwide as a case study of the relationship between numbers of predators and their prey."
"In vertebrate anatomy, ribs (Latin: costae) are the long curved bones which form the rib cage, part of the axial skeleton."
"In most tetrapods, ribs surround the chest, enabling the lungs to expand and thus facilitate breathing by expanding the chest cavity."
"They serve to protect the lungs, heart, and other internal organs of the thorax."
"In some animals, especially snakes, ribs may provide support and protection for the entire body."
A liquid is a nearly incompressible fluid that conforms to the shape of its container but retains a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
"As such, it is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, gas, and plasma), and is the only state with a definite volume but no fixed shape."
"A liquid is made up of tiny vibrating particles of matter, such as atoms, held together by intermolecular bonds."
"Like a gas, a liquid is able to flow and take the shape of a container."
"Most liquids resist compression, although others can be compressed."
"Unlike a gas, a liquid does not disperse to fill every space of a container, and maintains a fairly constant density."
"A distinctive property of the liquid state is surface tension, leading to wetting phenomena."
"Water is, by far, the most common liquid on Earth."
"The density of a liquid is usually close to that of a solid, and much higher than in a gas."
"Therefore, liquid and solid are both termed condensed matter."
"On the other hand, as liquids and gases share the ability to flow, they are both called fluids."
"Although liquid water is abundant on Earth, this state of matter is actually the least common in the known universe, because liquids require a relatively narrow temperature/pressure range to exist."
Most known matter in the universe is in gaseous form (with traces of detectable solid matter) as interstellar clouds or in plasma from within stars.
"A noise barrier (also called a soundwall, noise wall, sound berm, sound barrier, or acoustical barrier) is an exterior structure designed to protect inhabitants of sensitive land use areas from noise pollution."
"Noise barriers are the most effective method of mitigating roadway, railway, and industrial noise sources – 
other than cessation of the source activity or use of source controls."
"In the case of surface transportation noise, other methods of reducing the source noise intensity include encouraging the use of hybrid and electric vehicles, improving automobile aerodynamics and tire design, and choosing low-noise paving material."
Extensive use of noise barriers began in the United States after noise regulations were introduced in the early 1970s.
"A sidewalk (North American English), pavement (British English), footpath (Oceanian English), or footway, is a path along the side of a road."
"Usually constructed of concrete or asphalt, it is designed for pedestrians."
"A sidewalk may accommodate moderate changes in grade (height) and is normally separated from the vehicular section by a curb (spelled ""kerb"" outside North America)."
"There may also be a median strip or road verge (a strip of vegetation, grass or bushes or trees or a combination of these) either between the sidewalk and the roadway or between the sidewalk and the boundary."
"In some places, the same term may also be used for a paved path, trail or footpath that is not next to a road, for example, a path through a park."
A candlestick is a device used to hold a candle in place.
"Candlesticks have a cup or a spike (""pricket"") or both to keep the candle in place."
"Candlesticks are less frequently called ""candleholders""."
"Before the proliferation of electricity, candles were carried between rooms using a chamberstick, a short candlestick with a pan to catch dripping wax.Although electric lighting has phased out candles in much of the world, candlesticks and candelabras are still used in homes as decorative elements or to add atmosphere on special occasions."
"Rhode Island ( (listen), like road), officially the State of Rhode Island, is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States."
"It is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly fewer than 1.1 million residents as of 2020, but it is the second-most densely populated after New Jersey."
"It takes its name from the eponymous island, though most of its land area is on the mainland."
"Rhode Island borders Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; it also shares a small maritime border with New York."
Providence is its capital and most populous city.
Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay for thousands of years before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century.
"Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies for being founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution from the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty."
"He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government."
"The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker ""Rogue's Island"".Reflecting its status as a hub of relative tolerance and free thought, Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress in 1774 and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776."
"After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 9, 1778."
"Favoring a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that drafted the United States Constitution, which it initially refused to ratify; it was the last of the original 13 states to do so, on May 29, 1790.Formerly named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era, in November 2020 the state's voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping ""and Providence Plantations"" from its full name."
"Its official nickname is the ""Ocean State"", a reference to its 400 miles (640 km) of coastline and the large bays and inlets that comprise about 14% of its total area."
"An instrumental is a recording normally without any vocals, although it might include some inarticulate vocals, such as shouted backup vocals in a big band setting."
"Through semantic widening, a broader sense of the word song may refer to instrumentals."
The music is primarily or exclusively produced using musical instruments.
"An instrumental can exist in music notation, after it is written by a composer; in the mind of the composer (especially in cases where the composer themselves will perform the piece, as in the case of a blues solo guitarist or a folk music fiddle player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a musical ensemble, which could range in components from a duo or trio to a large big band, concert band or orchestra."
"In a song that is otherwise sung, a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an instrumental interlude, or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental introduction."
"If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a ""solo"" (e.g., the guitar solo that is a key section of heavy metal music and hard rock songs)."
"If the instruments are percussion instruments, the interlude can be called a percussion interlude or ""percussion break""."
These interludes are a form of break in the song.
City limits or city boundaries refer to the defined boundary or border of a city.
The area within the city limit can be called the city proper.
Town limit/boundary and village limit/boundary apply to towns and villages.
"Similarly, corporate limit is a legal name that refers to the boundary of municipal corporations."
"In some countries, the limit of a municipality may be expanded through annexation."
Guardsman is a rank used instead of private in some military units that serve as the official bodyguard of a sovereign or head of state.
It is also used as a generic term for any member of a guards unit of any rank.
"A brother is a man or boy who shares one or more parents with another, a sibling."
The female counterpart is a sister.
"Although the term typically refers to a familial relationship, it is sometimes used endearingly to refer to non-familial relationships."
A full brother is a first degree relative.
"Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance: a play, opera, mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television."
"Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's Poetics (c. 335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.The term ""drama"" comes from a Greek word ""draō"" meaning ""to do / to act"" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drama), which is derived from ""I do"" (Classical Greek: δράω, drao)."
The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy.
"In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game (translating the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was a play-house rather than a theatre.The use of ""drama"" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern era."
"""Drama"" in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example, Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887)."
"It is this narrower sense that the film and television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe ""drama"" as a genre within their respective media."
The term ”radio drama“ has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a live performance.
"May also refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic output of radio.The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception."
"The structure of dramatic texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and collective reception.Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body."
"Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in some ballets dance ""expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action""."
"Musicals include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example)."
"Closet drama is a form that is intended to be read, rather than performed."
"In improvisation, the drama does not pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an audience."
"A lake is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, and set apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake."
"Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although, like the much larger oceans, they do form part of the Earth's water cycle."
"Lakes are distinct from lagoons, which are generally coastal parts of the ocean."
"Lakes are typically larger and deeper than ponds, which also lie on land, though there are no official or scientific definitions."
"Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which usually flow in a channel on land."
"Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams.Natural lakes are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing glaciation."
"Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers, where a river channel has widened into a basin."
Some parts of the world have many lakes formed by the chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.
"All lakes are temporary over long periods of time, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them."
"Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for industrial or agricultural use, for hydro-electric power generation or domestic water supply, for aesthetic or recreational purposes, or for other activities."
"A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time."
"Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements."
Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area.
"A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy."
"Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while video games are more popular nowadays following technological advances."
The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in hobbies.
"Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time."
"Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally project-based leisure which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding."
"Ecballium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae containing a single species, Ecballium elaterium, also called the squirting cucumber or exploding cucumber (not the same plant as Cyclanthera brachystachya)."
"Its unusual common name derives from the ripe fruit squirting a stream of mucilaginous liquid containing its seeds as a means of seed dispersal, an example of rapid plant movement."
An observation tower is a structure used to view events from a long distance and to create a full 360 degree range of vision to conduct long distance observations.
"Observation towers are usually at least 20 metres (66 ft) tall and are made from stone, iron, and wood."
"Many modern towers are also used as TV towers, restaurants, or churches."
"The towers first appeared in the ancient world, as long ago as the Babylonian Empire."
Observation towers that are used as guard posts or observation posts over an extended period to overlook an area are commonly called watchtowers instead.
"Wilderness or wildlands (usually in the plural), are natural environments on Earth that have not been significantly modified by human activity or any nonurbanized land not under extensive agricultural cultivation."
"The term has traditionally referred to terrestrial environments, though growing attention is being placed on marine wilderness."
"Recent maps of wilderness suggest it covers roughly one quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface, but is being rapidly degraded by human activity."
"Even less wilderness remains in the ocean, with only 13.2% free from intense human activity.Some governments establish protection for wilderness areas by law to not only preserve what already exists, but also to promote and advance a natural expression and development."
"These can be set up in preserves, conservation preserves, national forests, national parks and even in urban areas along rivers, gulches or otherwise undeveloped areas."
"Often these areas are considered important for the survival of certain species, biodiversity, ecological studies, conservation, solitude and recreation."
"They may also preserve historic genetic traits and provide habitat for wild flora and fauna that may be difficult to recreate in zoos, arboretums or laboratories."
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism.
"Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals."
"The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth."
"Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts."
Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems.
"Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture."
"As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography."
"Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes."
"As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices."
"Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems."
"This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions."
Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.
"The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food."
"The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the ""right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food"", as well as the ""fundamental right to be free from hunger""."
"Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 ""Zero hunger"" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030."
"Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States."
"An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves."
"Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities."
"The seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time period."
The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
"At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing or disrupting the ground."
"When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami."
"Earthquakes can also trigger landslides and, occasionally, volcanic activity."
"In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves."
"Earthquakes are caused mostly by rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, and nuclear tests."
An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus.
The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter.
A financial adviser or financial advisor is a professional who provides financial services to clients based on their financial situation.
"In many countries, financial advisors must complete specific training and be registered with a regulatory body in order to provide advice."
"In the United States, a financial adviser carries a Series 7 and Series 66 or Series 65 qualification examination."
"According to the U.S. Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), qualification designations and compliance issues must be reported for public view."
"FINRA specifies the following groups who may use the term financial advisor: brokers, investment advisers, private bankers, accountants, lawyers, insurance agents and financial planners."
"In finance, stock (also capital stock) consists of all of the shares into which ownership of a corporation or company is divided."
"(Especially in American English, the word ""stocks"" is also used to refer to shares.)"
A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares.
"This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested."
"Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders."
"Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy."
The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account.
"As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business."
"Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price."
"Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price."
"This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."
Stocks are a function of capitalism and therefore the stock market operates by the price mechanism a stock cannot be classified as an investment unless it pays a dividend (the standard dividend yield is 2%) otherwise it must be classified as a speculation (gambling).
However if you decide to reinvest the dividends it is not speculation and assuming for ceteris paribus this will lead to an exponential growth of FV = P*(1+r/m)*m*t. Where P is the initial investment.
R is the yield.
M is dividends per year.
And t is number of years.
A dividend king is a stock which has had an increasing or constant dividend yield for over 50 successive years.
The Battle of the Beams was a period early in the Second World War when bombers of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) used a number of increasingly accurate systems of radio navigation for night bombing in the United Kingdom.
"British scientific intelligence at the Air Ministry fought back with a variety of their own increasingly effective means, involving jamming and deception signals."
"The period ended when the Wehrmacht moved their forces to the East in May 1941, in preparation for the attack on the Soviet Union.The idea of ""beam"" based navigation was developed during the 1930s, initially as a blind landing aid."
The basic concept is to produce two directional radio signals that are aimed slightly to the left and right of a runway's midline.
Radio operators in the aircraft listen for these signals and determine which of the two beams they are flying in.
"This is normally accomplished by sending Morse code signals into the two beams, to identify right and left."
"For bombing, the Luftwaffe built huge versions of the antennas to provide much greater accuracy at long range, named Knickebein and X-Gerät."
"These were used during the early stages of ""The Blitz"" with great effect, in one case laying a strip of bombs down the centerline of a factory deep in England."
"Tipped off about the system's operation by pre-war military intelligence, the British responded by sending their own Morse code signals so that the aircraft believed they were always properly centred in the beam while they flew wildly off course."
The Germans became convinced the British had somehow learned to bend radio signals.
"When the problem became widespread, the Germans introduced a new system that worked on different principles, the Y-Gerät."
"Having guessed the nature of this system from a passing mention, the British had already deployed countermeasures that rendered the system useless almost as soon as it was used."
"The Germans eventually gave up on the entire concept of radio navigation over the UK, concluding the British would continue to successfully jam it."
A still is an apparatus used to distill liquid mixtures by heating to selectively boil and then cooling to condense the vapor.
"A still uses the same concepts as a basic distillation apparatus, but on a much larger scale."
"Stills have been used to produce perfume and medicine, water for injection (WFI) for pharmaceutical use, generally to separate and purify different chemicals, and to produce distilled beverages containing ethanol."
"A chisel is a tool with a characteristically shaped cutting edge (such that wood chisels have lent part of their name to a particular grind) of blade on its end, for carving or cutting a hard material such as wood, stone, or metal by hand, struck with a mallet, or  mechanical power."
The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or of wood with a sharp edge in it.
Chiselling use involves forcing the blade into some material to cut it.
"The driving force may be applied by pushing by hand, or by using a mallet or hammer."
"In industrial use, a hydraulic ram or falling weight ('trip hammer') may be used to drive a chisel into the material."
"A gouge (one type of chisel) serves to carve small pieces from the material, particularly in woodworking, woodturning and sculpture."
Gouges  most frequently produce concave surfaces.
A gouge typically has a 'U'-shaped cross-section.
"A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite or graveyard is a place where the remains of dead people are buried or otherwise interred."
"The word cemetery (from Greek κοιμητήριον, ""sleeping place"") implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs."
"The term graveyard is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an ""above-ground grave"" (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, columbarium, niche, or other edifice."
"In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries."
These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs.
"Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both, continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled."
"""Circle of Life"" is a song from The Walt Disney Company 1994 animated film The Lion King."
"Composed by Elton John, with lyrics by Tim Rice, the song was performed by Carmen Twillie (the deep female lead vocals) and Lebo M. (opening vocals in Zulu) as the film's opening song."
"In an interview, Rice said he was amazed at the speed with which John composed: ""I gave him the lyrics at the beginning of the session at about two in the afternoon."
"By half-past three, he'd finished writing and recording a stunning demo."""
"Elton John sang a pop version (with alternative lyrics) of the song with the London Community Gospel Choir, which was included in the film's soundtrack and made into a music video."
"""Circle of Life"" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1994, along with two other songs from The Lion King: ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the latter of which won the award."
"""Circle of Life"" was also nominated for a Song of the Year Grammy."
The song reached No.
11 in the UK and No.
"18 in the US and is featured frequently in attractions based on The Lion King, such as Disney theme parks and parades."
Michael Crawford sang it as part of a medley for The Disney Album in 2001.
"The song was featured in Disney's 2019 photorealistic computer-animated remake of The Lion King and was used in the first trailer of the film, a near shot-for-shot remake of the opening of the original animated film."
"This new version of the song was performed by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the actress who performed as Rafiki in the stage adaptation of the movie in London from 2005 to 2018."
"However, the new version also retains the original Zulu opening vocals by Lebo M. from the 1994 film."
A road is a linear way for the conveyance of traffic that typically has an improved surface for use by vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) and pedestrians.
"Unlike streets, the primary function of roads is transportation."
"There are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and local roads."
"The primary features of roads include lanes, sidewalks (pavement), roadways (carriageways), medians, shoulders, verges, bike paths (cycle paths), and shared-use paths."
"A given name (also known as a first name or forename) is the part of a personal name that identifies a person, potentially with a middle name as well, and differentiates that person from the other members of a group (typically a family or clan) who have a common surname."
"The term given name refers to a name bestowed at or close to the time of birth, usually by the parents of the newborn."
"A Christian name is the first name which is given at baptism, in Christian custom."
"In informal situations, given names are often used in a familiar and friendly manner."
"In more formal situations, a person's surname is more commonly used."
"The idioms 'on a first-name basis' and 'being on first-name terms' refer to the familiarity inherent in addressing someone by their given name.By contrast, a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name) is normally inherited and shared with other members of one's immediate family."
Regnal names and religious or monastic names are special given names bestowed upon someone receiving a crown or entering a religious order; such a person then typically becomes known chiefly by that name.
"Jellyfish and sea jellies are the informal common names given to the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa, a major part of the phylum Cnidaria."
"Jellyfish are mainly free-swimming marine animals with umbrella-shaped bells and trailing tentacles, although a few are anchored to the seabed by stalks rather than being mobile."
The bell can pulsate to provide propulsion for highly efficient locomotion.
The tentacles are armed with stinging cells and may be used to capture prey and defend against predators.
"Jellyfish have a complex life cycle; the medusa is normally the sexual phase, which produces planula larva that disperse widely and enter a sedentary polyp phase before reaching sexual maturity."
"Jellyfish are found all over the world, from surface waters to the deep sea."
"Scyphozoans (the ""true jellyfish"") are exclusively marine, but some hydrozoans with a similar appearance live in freshwater."
"Large, often colorful, jellyfish are common in coastal zones worldwide."
"The medusae of most species are fast-growing, and mature within a few months then die soon after breeding, but the polyp stage, attached to the seabed, may be much more long-lived."
"Jellyfish have been in existence for at least 500 million years, and possibly 700 million years or more, making them the oldest multi-organ animal group.Jellyfish are eaten by humans in certain cultures."
"They are considered a delicacy in some Asian countries, where species in the Rhizostomae order are pressed and salted to remove excess water."
"Australian researchers have described them as a ""perfect food"", sustainable, and protein-rich but relatively low in food energy.They are also used in research, where the green fluorescent protein used by some species to cause bioluminescence has been adapted as a fluorescent marker for genes inserted into other cells or organisms."
The stinging cells used by jellyfish to subdue their prey can injure humans.
"Thousands of swimmers worldwide are stung every year, with effects ranging from mild discomfort to serious injury or even death."
"When conditions are favourable, jellyfish can form vast swarms, which can be responsible for damage to fishing gear by filling fishing nets, and sometimes clog the cooling systems of power and desalination plants which draw their water from the sea."
"An infant (from the Latin word infans, meaning 'unable to speak' or 'speechless') is the more formal or specialised synonym for the common term baby, meaning the very young offspring of human beings."
The term may also be used to refer to juveniles of other organisms.
"A newborn is, in colloquial use, an infant who is only hours, days, or up to one month old."
"In medical contexts, newborn or neonate (from Latin, neonatus, newborn) refers to an infant in the first 28 days after birth; the term applies to premature, full term, and postmature infants."
"Before birth, the term fetus is used."
"The term infant is typically applied to very young children under one year of age; however, definitions may vary and may include children up to two years of age."
"When a human child learns to walk, the term toddler may be used instead."
"A payment is the voluntary tender of money or its equivalent or of things of value by one party (such as a person or company) to another in exchange for goods, or services provided by them, or to fulfill a legal obligation."
"The party making the payment is commonly called the payer, while the payee is the party receiving the payment."
"Payments can be effected in a number of ways, for example:

the use of money, cheque, or debit, credit or bank transfers."
"the transfer of anything of value, such as stock, or using barter, the exchange of one good or service for another.In general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's legal tender up to a prescribed limit."
Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee unless the parties agree otherwise.
Payment in another currency involves an additional foreign exchange transaction.
"The payee may compromise on a debt, i.e., accept part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc."
"On the other hand, the payee may impose a surcharge, for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc."
"Payments are frequently preceded by an invoice or bill, which follow the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is becoming common for pre-payments to be required before the service is performed or provided."
"In some industries, a deposit may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider."
"In some cases, progress payments are made in advance, and in some cases part payments are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer’s legal obligations."
The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation.
"A creditor cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours."
A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a receipt to the payer.
"A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as ""paid in full""."
The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.
"Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food."
The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum).
The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE.
"Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis."
"Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares or 545 million acres, 2014)."
World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.
"In 2017, world production of wheat was 772 million tonnes (1.7 trillion pounds), with a forecast of 2019 production at 766 million tonnes (1.7 trillion pounds), making it the second most-produced cereal after maize."
"Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century."
"Global demand for wheat is increasing due to the unique viscoelastic and adhesive properties of gluten proteins, which facilitate the production of processed foods, whose consumption is increasing as a result of the worldwide industrialization process and the westernization of the diet.Wheat is an important source of carbohydrates."
"Globally, it is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals but relatively low in protein quality for supplying essential amino acids."
"When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber.In a small part of the general population, gluten – the major part of wheat protein – can trigger coeliac disease, noncoeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia, and dermatitis herpetiformis."
"In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves."
"In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height."
"In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees."
Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
"Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old."
Trees have been in existence for 370 million years.
It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature trees in the world.A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk.
"This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another."
For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
"Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil."
"Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots."
"The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development."
Trees usually reproduce using seeds.
"Flowers and fruit may be present, but some trees, such as conifers, instead have pollen cones and seed cones."
"Palms, bananas, and bamboos also produce seeds, but tree ferns produce spores instead."
Trees play a significant role in reducing erosion and moderating the climate.
They remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues.
Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.
Tropical rainforests are among the most biodiverse habitats in the world.
"Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses."
"In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture."
"Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies."
"A suit or lounge suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket and trousers of identical textiles worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie, and dress shoes."
It is considered informal wear in Western dress codes.
The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as a more casual alternative for sportswear and British country clothing.
"After replacing the black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-colored suit became known as a lounge suit."
A black lounge suit for professional occasions became known as a business suit and belongs to the day dress of the semi-formal wear dress code.Suits are offered in different designs and constructions.
"Cut and cloth, whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to various accessories."
A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers; a three-piece suit adds a waistcoat.
Hats were almost always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture.
"Informal suits have been traditionally worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap."
"Other accessories include handkerchief, suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry."
"Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions—the dinner suit (black tie) and the black lounge suit (stroller)—both which arose as less formal alternatives for the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers for morning dress, respectively."
"Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth."
"These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style preferences."
"Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments."
"Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways:

bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor from a pattern created entirely from the customer's measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of fabric;
made to measure, in which a pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a limited selection of options and fabrics is available;
ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although some tailor alteration tends to be required;
suit separates, where lounge jacket and trousers are sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, including also odd-colored blazers or sports coats as smart casual options"
"A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains heated air."
"Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused by burning liquid propane."
"The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant, since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope."
"As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere."
"The envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air inside the envelope is at about the same pressure as the surrounding air."
"In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric, and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire-resistant material such as Nomex."
"Modern balloons have been made in many shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial and many commercial applications."
The hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology.
"The first untethered manned hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes on November 21, 1783, in Paris, France, in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers."
"The first hot air balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793, by the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard."
Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.
"Smoke  is a collection of airborne particulates and gases emitted when a material undergoes combustion or pyrolysis, together with the quantity of air that is entrained or otherwise mixed into the mass."
"It is commonly an unwanted by-product of fires (including stoves, candles, internal combustion engines, oil lamps, and fireplaces), but may also be used for pest control (fumigation), communication (smoke signals), defensive and offensive capabilities in the military (smoke screen), cooking, or smoking (tobacco, cannabis, etc.)."
"It is used in rituals where incense, sage, or resin is burned to produce a smell for spiritual or magical purposes."
It can also be a flavoring agent and preservative.
Smoke inhalation is the primary cause of death in victims of indoor fires.
"The smoke kills by a combination of thermal damage, poisoning and pulmonary irritation caused by carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide and other combustion products."
Smoke is an aerosol (or mist) of solid particles and liquid droplets that are close to the ideal range of sizes for Mie scattering of visible light.
"A map is a symbolic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as objects, regions, or themes."
"Many maps are static, fixed to paper or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive."
"Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any space, real or fictional, without regard to context or scale, such as in brain mapping, DNA mapping, or computer network topology mapping."
"The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables."
"Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times."
"The word ""map"" comes from the medieval Latin Mappa mundi, wherein mappa meant napkin or cloth and mundi the world."
"Thus, ""map"" became a shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world."
An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
"Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
"This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"Election is the fact of electing, or being elected."
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams."
"Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen."
Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
Vast deposits of coal originate in former wetlands—called coal forests—that covered much of the Earth's tropical land areas during the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) and Permian times.
"However, many significant coal deposits are younger than this and originate from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras."
Coal is primarily used as a fuel.
"While coal has been known and used for thousands of years, its usage was limited until the Industrial Revolution."
"With the invention of the steam engine, coal consumption increased."
In 2020 coal supplied about a quarter of the world's primary energy and over a third of  its electricity.
Some iron and steel making and other industrial processes burn coal.
The extraction and use of coal causes premature deaths and illness.
"The use of coal damages the environment, and it is the largest anthropogenic source of carbon dioxide contributing to climate change."
"14 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide was emitted by burning coal in 2020, which is 40% of the total fossil fuel emissions and over 25% of total global greenhouse gas emissions."
As part of the worldwide energy transition many countries have reduced or eliminated their use of coal power.
The UN Secretary General asked governments to stop building new coal plants by 2020.
Global coal use peaked in 2013.
"To meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global warming to below 2 °C (3.6 °F) coal use needs to halve from 2020 to 2030, and phasing down coal was agreed in the Glasgow Climate Pact."
The largest consumer and importer of coal in 2020 was China.
"China accounts for almost half the world's annual coal production, followed by India with about a tenth."
"Indonesia and Australia export the most, followed by Russia."
"Placeholder names are words that can refer to things or people whose names do not exist, are temporarily forgotten, are to avoid stigmatization, or unknown in the context in which they are being discussed, or one is unable to or does not care to specify precisely."
"Height is  measure of vertical distance, either vertical extent (how ""tall"" something or someone is) or vertical position (how ""high"" a point is)."
"For example, ""The height of that building is 50 m"" or ""The height of an airplane in-flight is about 10,000 m""."
"When the term is used to describe vertical position (of, e.g., an airplane) from sea level, height is more often called altitude."
"Furthermore, if the point is attached to the Earth (e.g., a mountain peak), then altitude (height above sea level) is called elevation.In a two-dimensional Cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value."
"If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height is zero."
"In three-dimensional space, height is measured along the vertical z axis, describing a distance from (or ""above"") the x-y plane."
Naturism is a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social nudity in private and in public; the word also refers to the cultural movement which advocates and defends that lifestyle.
Both may alternatively be called nudism.
"Though the two terms are broadly interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated."
"That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology."
"Ethical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing."
"At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose."
"Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities."
"Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals through officially designated nude beaches and parks and on to public spaces and buildings in some jurisdictions."
Rapeseed (Brassica napus subsp.
"napus), also known as rape, or oilseed rape, is a bright-yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family), cultivated mainly for its oil-rich seed, which naturally contains appreciable amounts of erucic acid."
Canola are a group of rapeseed cultivars which were bred to have very low levels of erucic acid and are especially prized for use for human and animal food.
Rapeseed is the third-largest source of vegetable oil and the second-largest source of protein meal in the world.
"The Bronx () is a borough of New York City, coextensive with Bronx County, in the U.S. state of New York."
"It is south of Westchester County; north and east of the New York City borough of Manhattan, across the Harlem River; and north of the New York City borough of Queens, across the East River."
"The Bronx has a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,472,654 in the 2020 census."
"If each borough were ranked as a city, the Bronx would rank as the ninth-most-populous in the U.S. Of the five boroughs, it has the fourth-largest area, fourth-highest population, and third-highest population density."
It is the only borough of New York City not primarily on an island.
"With a population that is 54.8% Hispanic as of 2020, it is the only majority-Hispanic county in the Northeastern United States and the fourth-most-populous nationwide.The Bronx is divided by the Bronx River into a hillier section in the west, and a flatter eastern section."
East and west street names are divided by Jerome Avenue.
"The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895."
Bronx County was separated from New York County in 1914.
"About a quarter of the Bronx's area is open space, including Woodlawn Cemetery, Van Cortlandt Park, Pelham Bay Park, the New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo in the borough's north and center."
The Thain Family Forest at the New York Botanical Garden is thousands of years old; it is New York City's largest remaining tract of the original forest that once covered the city.
These open spaces are primarily on land reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from Manhattan.
"The word ""Bronx"" originated with Faroese-born (or Swedish-born) Jonas Bronck, who established the first settlement in the area as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639."
European settlers displaced the native Lenape after 1643.
"In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant and migrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from European countries (particularly Ireland, Germany, Italy and Eastern Europe) and later from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic), as well as African American migrants from the southern United States.The Bronx contains the poorest congressional district in the United States, the 15th."
"There are, however, some upper-income, as well as middle-income neighborhoods such as Riverdale, Fieldston, Spuyten Duyvil, Schuylerville, Pelham Bay, Pelham Gardens, Morris Park, and Country Club."
"Parts of the Bronx saw a steep decline in population, livable housing, and quality of life in the late 1960s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and into the early 1990s, culminating in a wave of arson in the late 1970s."
"The South Bronx, in particular, experienced severe urban decay."
The borough began experiencing new population growth starting in the late 1990s and continuing to present.
Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence.
"In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups."
"Throughout history, leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties."
"Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduced conflict, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity."
"""Psychological peace"" (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined, yet often a necessary precursor to establishing ""behavioral peace."""
"Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a ""peaceful inner disposition."""
Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life.
"The acquisition of such a ""peaceful internal disposition"" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests."
"Peace is not often in the state of excitement although we are happy when excited, but peace is when one's mind is quiet and satisfied."
"A head is the part of an organism which usually includes the ears, brain, forehead, cheeks, chin, eyes, nose, and mouth, each of which aid in various sensory functions such as sight, hearing, smell, and taste, respectively."
"Some very simple animals may not have a head, but many bilaterally symmetric forms do, regardless of size."
Heads develop in animals by an evolutionary trend known as cephalization.
"In bilaterally symmetrical animals, nervous tissues concentrate at the anterior region, forming structures responsible for information processing."
"Through biological evolution, sense organs and feeding structures also concentrate into the anterior region; these collectively form the head."
"The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates."
The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ.
"In the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion, following chewing."
It performs a chemical breakdown by means of enzymes and hydrochloric acid.
"In humans and many other animals, the stomach is located between the oesophagus and the small intestine."
The stomach secretes digestive enzymes and gastric acid to aid in food digestion.
"The pyloric sphincter controls the passage of partially digested food (chyme) from the stomach into the duodenum, where peristalsis takes over to move this through the rest of intestines."
Begonia  is a genus of perennial flowering plants in the family Begoniaceae.
"The genus contains more than 2,000 different plant species."
The Begonias are native to moist subtropical and tropical climates.
Some species are commonly grown indoors as ornamental houseplants in cooler climates.
"In cooler climates some species are cultivated outside in summertime for their bright colorful flowers, which have sepals but no petals."
A telephone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly.
"A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user."
"The term is derived from Greek: τῆλε (tēle, far) and φωνή (phōnē, voice), together meaning distant voice."
"A common short form of the term is phone, which came into use almost immediately after the first patent was issued.In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was the first to be granted a United States patent for a device that produced clearly intelligible replication of the human voice at a second device."
"This instrument was further developed by many others, and became rapidly indispensable in business, government, and in households."
The essential elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location.
"In addition, most telephones contain a ringer to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone."
The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation.
The dial may be located either on the handset or on a base unit to which the handset is connected.
"The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through a telephone network to the receiving telephone, which converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver or sometimes a loudspeaker."
"Telephones are duplex devices, meaning they permit transmission in both directions simultaneously."
The first telephones were directly connected to each other from one customer's office or residence to another customer's location.
"Being impractical beyond just a few customers, these systems were quickly replaced by manually operated centrally located switchboards."
"These exchanges were soon connected together, eventually forming an automated, worldwide public switched telephone network."
"For greater mobility, various radio systems were developed for transmission between mobile stations on ships and automobiles in the mid-20th century."
Hand-held mobile phones were introduced for personal service starting in 1973.
"In later decades, their analog cellular system evolved into digital networks with greater capability and lower cost."
Convergence has given most modern cell phones capabilities far beyond simple voice conversation.
"Most are smartphones, integrating all mobile communication and many computing needs."
"A zipper, zip, fly, or zip fastener, formerly known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, such as on a garment or a bag."
"It is used in clothing (e.g., jackets and jeans), luggage and other bags, sporting goods, camping gear (e.g."
"tents and sleeping bags), and other items."
"Zippers come in all different sizes, shapes, and colors."
"Whitcomb L. Judson, who was an American inventor from Chicago, is sometimes given credit as the inventor of the zipper, but his device was used for footwear, not clothing."
"The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth."
"Initially, it was titled the ""hookless fastener"" and was later redesigned to become more reliable."
"Birth is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth offspring, also referred to in technical contexts as parturition."
"In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe."
In some species the offspring is precocial and can move around almost immediately after birth but in others it is altricial and completely dependent on parenting.
"In marsupials, the fetus is born at a very immature stage after a short gestational period and develops further in its mother's womb's  pouch."
It is not only mammals that give birth.
"Some reptiles, amphibians, fish and invertebrates carry their developing young inside them."
"Some of these are ovoviviparous, with the eggs being hatched inside the mother's body, and others are viviparous, with the embryo developing inside her body, as in the case of mammals."
Land is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently submerged in water.
"Most but not all land is situated at elevations above sea level (variable over geologic time frames) and consists mainly of crustal components such as rock, sand, soil, and sometimes ice."
"The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources."
"Some life forms, including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals, have developed from predecessor species that originated in the bodies of water."
Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones.
The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans.
The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors.
A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation.
A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land.
"Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun."
Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.
"In reference to business terminology land is also associated with factor of production, as well as land is the first factor of production and the income or profit earned with help of land is treated as rent."
Tom Bombadil is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.
"He first appeared in print in a 1934 poem called The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, which also included the Lord of the Rings characters Goldberry (Tom's wife), Old Man Willow (an evil tree in Tom's forest) and the Barrow-wight, from whom Tom rescues the hobbits."
"They were not then explicitly part of the older legends that became The Silmarillion, and are not mentioned in The Hobbit."
"Bombadil is best known from his appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien's high fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings, published in 1954 and 1955."
"In the first volume, The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo Baggins and company meet Bombadil in the Old Forest."
This idea and an appearance by both Old Man Willow and the Barrow-wight were included in some of Tolkien's earliest notes for a sequel to The Hobbit.
"Bombadil is mentioned but not seen near the end of The Return of the King, with Gandalf planning to pay him a long visit."
"Bombadil was omitted from Peter Jackson's film trilogy, the 1978 film and radio adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, as non-essential to the story."
Commentators have debated the role and origins of Tom Bombadil.
"A likely source is the demigod Väinämöinen in the 1849 Finnish epic poem Kalevala, with many points of resemblance."
"Scholars have noted that he is the spirit of a place, a genius loci."
"A pistol is a handgun, more specifically one with the chamber integral to its gun barrel, though in common usage the two terms are often used interchangeably."
The English word was introduced in ca.
1570 – when early handguns were produced in Europe and is derived from the Middle French pistolet (ca.
"1550), meaning a small gun or knife."
"In colloquial usage, the word ""pistol"" is often used to describe any type of handgun, inclusive of revolvers (which have a single barrel and a separate cylinder housing multiple chambers) and the pocket-sized derringers (which are often multi-barrelled)."
"The most common type of pistol used in the contemporary era is the semi-automatic pistol, while the older single-shot and manual repeating pistols are now rarely seen and used primarily for nostalgic hunting and historical reenactment, and the fully automatic machine pistols are uncommon in civilian usage due to generally poor recoil-controllability and strict laws and regulations governing their manufacture and sale."
A dragon is a snake-like legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide.
"Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire."
"Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence."
The earliest attested reports of draconic creatures resemble giant snakes.
Draconic creatures are first described in the mythologies of the ancient Near East and appear in ancient Mesopotamian art and literature.
Stories about storm-gods slaying giant serpents occur throughout nearly all Indo-European and Near Eastern mythologies.
"Famous prototypical draconic creatures include the mušḫuššu of ancient Mesopotamia; Apep in Egyptian mythology; Vṛtra in the Rigveda; the Leviathan in the Hebrew Bible; Grand'Goule in the Poitou region in France; Python, Ladon, Wyvern, Kulshedra in Albanian Mythology and the Lernaean Hydra in Greek mythology; Jörmungandr, Níðhöggr, and Fafnir in Norse mythology; and the dragon from Beowulf."
"The popular western image of a dragon is likely based on a conflation of earlier dragons from different traditions, and of inaccurate scribal drawings of snakes."
"In western cultures, dragons are portrayed as monsters to be tamed or overcome, usually by saints or culture heroes, as in the popular legend of Saint George and the Dragon."
"They are often said to have ravenous appetites and to live in caves, where they hoard treasure."
"These dragons appear frequently in western fantasy literature, including The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien, the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, and A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin."
"The word ""dragon"" has also come to be applied to the legendary creature in Chinese mythology, loong (traditional 龍, simplified 龙, Japanese simplified 竜, Pinyin lóng), which is associated with good fortune and is thought to have power over rain."
Dragons and their associations with rain are the source of the Chinese customs of dragon dancing and dragon boat racing.
Many East Asian deities and demigods have dragons as their personal mounts or companions.
"Dragons were also identified with the Emperor of China, who, during later Chinese imperial history, was the only one permitted to have dragons on his house, clothing, or personal articles."
"The impression of dragons in a large number of Asian countries has been influenced by Chinese culture, such as Korea, Vietnam, Japan and so on."
"Chinese tradition has always used the dragon totem as the national emblem, and the ""Yellow Dragon flag"" of the Qing Dynasty has influenced the impression that China is a dragon in many European countries."
"The white dragon of the flag of modern Bhutan is a very classic Chinese style dragon.Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features, and may include: snakelike features, reptilian scaly skin, four legs with three or four toes on each, spinal nodes running down the back, a tail, and a serrated jaw with rows of teeth."
"Several modern scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery."
"A birthday is the anniversary of the birth of a person, or figuratively of an institution."
"Birthdays of people are celebrated in numerous cultures, often with birthday gifts, birthday cards, a birthday party, or a rite of passage."
Many religions celebrate the birth of their founders or religious figures with special holidays (e.g.
"Christmas, Mawlid, Buddha's Birthday, and Krishna Janmashtami)."
"There is a distinction between birthday and birthdate: The former, other than February 29, occurs each year (e.g."
"January 15), while the latter is the exact date a person was born (e.g."
"January 15, 2001)."
"Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium."
There are many types of hockey.
"Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while others do not."
"In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word ""hockey"" is often preceded by another word i.e."
"""field hockey"", ""ice hockey"", ""roller hockey"", ""rink hockey"", or ""floor hockey""."
"In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick."
"Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a ""puck"") with a hole in the center instead."
The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks.
The second case involves a variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics.
"The floor game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which was invented in Canada in 1963."
"Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936."
"In most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.In more recent history, the word ""hockey"" is used in reference to either the summer sport of field hockey, which is a stick and ball game, and the winter ice team skating sports of bandy and ice hockey."
"This is due to the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and their related variants preceded games which would eventually be played on ice with ice skates, namely bandy and ice hockey, as well as sports involving dry floors such as roller hockey and floor hockey."
"However, the ""hockey"" referred to in common parlance often depends on locale, geography, and the size and popularity of the sport involved."
"For example, in Europe, ""hockey"" more typically refers to field hockey, whereas in Canada, it typically refers to ice hockey."
"In the case of bandy, the game was initially called ""hockey on the ice"" and preceded the organization and development of ice hockey, but was officially changed to ""bandy"" in the early 20th century in order to avoid confusion with ice hockey, a separate sport."
